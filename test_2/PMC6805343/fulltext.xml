Production of <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> increased dramatically over the last 20&#x02009;years and has exceeded 200,000&#x02009;t per year since 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A major problem in the cultivation of <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> relates to loss through infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, and fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One of the most serious viral threats to <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> culture is <italic>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</italic> nodavirus (<italic>Mr</italic>NV) that causes white tail disease (WTD). This disease was first discovered in Guadeloupe Island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and subsequently in Taiwan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], Thailand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. <italic>Mr</italic>NV is a non-enveloped, icosahedron with 26&#x02013;27&#x02009;nm diameter composed of a nucleocapsid bearing two positive single-stranded RNA genomes (RNA-1 and RNA-2). RNA-1 is 3202&#x02009;bp - ssRNA encoding protein A or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and protein B2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Protein B2 is capable of inhibiting the RNAi pathway of the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. RNA-2 is 1175&#x02009;bp - ssRNA encoding capsid protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The prominent sign of infected post larvae (PL) is the appearance of whitish muscle commonly in abdominal region. Mortalities may reach 100% within 7&#x02013;15&#x02009;days after the infection or 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;days after the appearance of the first anatomical signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, experimental transmission of <italic>Mr</italic>NV revealed that the virus failed to cause mortality in adult prawns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As there is no cure for WTD infected prawns, preventive procedures have been implemented such as screening of brood stock and PL, and good farm management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Understanding the prawn&#x02019;s immune response specifically to WTD may also provide bio-rationale targets to help contain and restrict disease outbreak.</p><p id="Par35">As an arthropod crustacean, the innate immune system of <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> is composed of both humoral and cellular responses. Humoral immune responses include up-regulation of the prophenol oxidase system (ProPO), clotting proteins, melanization and antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cellular immune responses involve hemocyte activities such as phagocytosis, apoptosis, nodule formation, and encapsulation which function to neutralize pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Indirect recognition of pathogens or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll receptors leads to the activation of these humoral and cellular immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">In recent years, high-throughput technology such as next generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged and is widely used in both genomic and transcriptomic research. NGS technology can also be used to study differential gene-expression on various tissues or certain conditions such as stress and pathogen infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and in both model, and non-model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There are transcriptomic studies for penaeid shrimps such as <italic>Peneaus monodon</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], <italic>Litopeneaus vannamei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], <italic>Fenneropeneaus chinensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], <italic>Fenneropenaeus merguiensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and <italic>Marsupeneaus japonicus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] to investigate tissue-specific expression, the stress response, and viral infection. Moreover, many studies have been performed on whole transcriptome sequencing of the hepatopancreas of <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> in response to <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], hepatopancreas and lymphoid organ in response to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and intestinal tissue in response to WSSV or the viral PAMP mimic (poly I:C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Most recently, transcriptomic analysis of hematopoietic tissue of <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> adult prawn in response to <italic>Mr</italic>NV infection has been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Therefore, we aimed for maximizing transcriptome coverage while minimizing the redundancy to generate high quality transcriptome. The BUSCO results showed that the assembled transcriptome was highly complete (C:83.4%) with low fragmentation (F:13%), missing (M:3.3%), and duplication (D:16.2%).

In this study, all read data were merged before the assembly, resulting in an increase in the abundance of low expressed transcripts, therefore increasing coverage of the assembled transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In addition, the highest E<sub>x</sub>N<sub>50</sub> value at 94% indicated that the assembled transcripts had high coverage and was assembled from sufficient read data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">To identify differentially abundance transcripts associated with <italic>Mr</italic>NV infection, we performed RNA sequencing on six replicates of each healthy PL and experimentally <italic>Mr</italic>NV infected PL.

Among those transcripts, some of these were involved in the innate immune system in response to viral infection.</p><p id="Par52">To validate our transcript assembly and differential abundance results, we also selected 9 targets for validation with qPCR, and demonstrated a very low false discovery rate in these genes. We filtered our list of DEGs according to functional groups of importance including pattern recognition proteins (PRPs) and antiviral protein, prophenol oxidase (ProPO) system, the Toll-IMD signaling pathways, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and blood clotting system, phagocytosis and apoptosis, antioxidant system, and RNA interference (RNAi). Numerous studies demonstrated high correlation between RNAseq and qPCR data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

To enhance our confidence, we validated these results in independent biological samples.</p><p id="Par53">Crustacean innate immune system requires the recognition of the pathogens by pattern recognition proteins (PRPs) to trigger the immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. PRPs are groups of germ-line encoded proteins that can activate humoral and cellular immune response via immune signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Several studies identified prawn PRPs and examined its role in prawn immune system regarding viral infection. <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> C-type lectin (<italic>Mr</italic>CTL) expression in hepatopancreas was up-regulated after a challenge with <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> or white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Ficolin expression in <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> hepatopancreas was found to be up-regulated after the infection of <italic>V. anguillarum</italic> and WSSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

In this study, various PRPs such as C-type lectin, ficolin, and antiviral protein which are part of C-type lectin family were differentially expressed after the infection of <italic>Mr</italic>NV suggesting that these PRPs play important roles in immune system against <italic>Mr</italic>NV infection. Importantly, we validated the expression of one of these genes, antiviral protein, which was up-regulated by 2.48-fold in the RNAseq and 8.97-fold by qPCR (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). However, in our results, MBL expression was down-regulated which contradicts the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This maybe because MBL is not required for antiviral response of post-larvae prawn against <italic>Mr</italic>NV or the expression of MBL in post-larvae prawn being suppressed by <italic>Mr</italic>NV. Further investigation is needed to understand the effects of <italic>Mr</italic>NV to MBL expression in post-larvae stage.</p><p id="Par54">Prophenol oxidase (ProPO) activating system participates in first line of immune system by triggering melanization and other responses such as hemocyte induction, encapsulation, and nodule formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Recognition of PAMPs by PRPs leads to activation of serine proteinases cascade, resulting in the production of active PO enzyme. The active PO enzyme produces polymeric melanin around invading pathogens resulting in melanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The RNAseq presented here shows a 2.01-fold up-regulation of ProPO expression in response to <italic>Mr</italic>NV infection in which the expression was validated by qPCR (9.38-fold up-regulation; Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). In addition, three types of prophenoloxidase activating enzyme were also up-regulated in RNAseq results. These results indicate involvement of ProPO-activating system in <italic>Mr</italic>NV infection.</p><p id="Par55">The Toll-IMD signaling pathways are considered to be the most crucial immune signaling pathways in invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The toll receptor is triggered by cytokine-like ligand Sp&#x000e4;tzle whereas vertebrate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogens directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Triggering the toll receptor leads to activation of NF-kappa-B family protein Dif/Dorsal and then leads to up-regulation of immune-related genes such as antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Toll receptor from <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and was found to be gradually up-regulated in gills during the WSSV challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> sp&#x000e4;tzle protein has been found to be up-regulated in hemocytes after the bacteria infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In addition, sp&#x000e4;tzle protein in <italic>F. chinensis</italic> was up-regulated after challenged with <italic>V. anguillarum</italic> and WSSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p110,also known as relish, is an important nuclear transcription factor in the IMD signaling pathway which functions parallel to the Toll pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> relish was reported to be involved in bacterial infection and overexpression of relish induced the expression of various AMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In this study, we found that the toll and NF-kappa-B p110 expression were up-regulated after the infection of <italic>Mr</italic>NV, whereas the expression of sp&#x000e4;tzle was down-regulated. We also validated the expression of sp&#x000e4;tzle using qPCR which was 3.26-fold down-regulated compared to 17.88-fold down-regulated in RNAseq (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). These results suggested that these genes are involved in the immune system against <italic>Mr</italic>NV infection. Down-regulation of sp&#x000e4;tzle may be caused by a negative feedback regulation from the activation of the toll pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are also important components in first line of immune system. AMPs are usually small cationic, amphipathic, germ-line encoded proteins that have rapid and efficient antimicrobial effects against broad spectrum of microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. AMPs differ in structural conformation, charge, and amphipathicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Fundamentally, AMPs disrupt the membrane integrity of the target and then destroy the microbe by membrane destabilization or pore formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Several studies reported that anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (ALFs) and lysozymes expression were up-regulated after the infection of WSSV in <italic>M. rosenbergii, F. chinensis</italic>, and <italic>L. vannamei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

However, crustin isoform 1 and 2 expression in <italic>P. monodon</italic> were down-regulated after WSSV infection, whereas crustin isoform 3 was up-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In our report, ALFs, i-type lysozyme-like protein 2 (LYZL2), and crustin members were differentially expressed during <italic>Mr</italic>NV infection. ALFs and LYZL2 were up-regulated, whereas several crustin isoforms were both up- and down-regulated. Additionally, the validation by qPCR showed that ALF1 was up-regulated by 5.86-fold which was comparable to the 2.25-fold up-regulation by RNAseq (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). These suggested that ALFs and LYZL2 are involved in the prawn immune response against <italic>Mr</italic>NV, whereas only certain isoforms of crustin are involved.</p><p id="Par57">Blood clotting is a humoral response which prevents hemolymph loss and microbial spread during injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In crustacean, blood clotting involves cross-linking aggregation of clotting proteins (CPs) by calcium-dependent transglutaminase (TGase) produced by the hemocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Previous studies showed that lysozyme and crustin expression in <italic>M. japonicus</italic> were down-regulated in TGase depleted prawn suggesting that there is a link between the blood clotting system and AMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. We found that transglutaminase and hemicentin-1-like isoform X2 (HMCN1) expression were up-regulated. In addition, we validated the expression of HMCN1 which was up-regulated by 5.31-fold in the RNAseq and 16.07-fold by qPCR (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). These results suggested that these two blood coagulation components are involved as a response to the infection of <italic>Mr</italic>NV. Moreover, up-regulation of two blood coagulation components, lysozyme, and certain isoforms of crustin may indicate a link between the blood clotting system and AMPs in <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic>.</p><p id="Par58">Apoptosis or programmed cell death plays an important role in cellular immune response by limiting viral replication and eliminating virus-infected cells in multicellular organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Apoptosis requires the activation of caspases, highly conserved cysteine proteases that are involved in the execution of cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Previous studies characterized <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> caspase (<italic>Mr</italic>Casp) and demonstrated that the capsid protein of <italic>Mr</italic>NV could inhibit apoptotic responses of <italic>Mr</italic>Casp in Sf9 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> caspase 3c expression in hemocyte was found to be up-regulated after IHHNV challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) has been characterized and was found to be up-regulated in hepatopancreas after IHHNV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. IAP is one of the apoptosis regulators that binds and inhibits the activity of caspase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>L. vannamei</italic> IAPs-silenced by RNAi demonstrated higher expression of WSSV genes and significant down-regulation of AMP genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In this study, we reported up-regulation of caspase, caspase4, and IAP in response to <italic>Mr</italic>NV challenge. We also validated the expression of caspase which was 2.64-fold up-regulation in RNAseq and 12.05-fold by qPCR (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Up-regulation of these genes suggests that these gene are involved in <italic>Mr</italic>NV infection.</p><p id="Par59">Phagocytosis plays a role in innate immune system by ingesting microparticles including microbial pathogens and cellular debris from apoptosis and necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].

We validated, ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs), using qPCR and found 5.45-fold up-regulation compared to 2.19-fold by RNAseq (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).

Dicer, RNase III-like enzyme, is responsible for the cleavage of long dsRNA into 21&#x02013;30&#x02009;bp siRNA which initiates RNAi mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Genome derived silencing RNAs (siRNAs) are unwound and incorporated with argonaute protein which is the main component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. RISC then recognizes and degrades target mRNA which represses the expression of the target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>].

Recent studies revealed that 31 miRNAs were differentially expressed during WSSV infection suggesting that these miRNA may be involved in innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>].
