MetaBAT has become one of the most popular binning tools largely due to its computational efficiency and ease of use, especially in binning experiments with a large number of samples and a large assembly. MetaBAT requires users to choose parameters to fine-tune its sensitivity and specificity. If those parameters are not chosen properly, binning accuracy can suffer, especially on assemblies of poor quality. Here, we developed MetaBAT 2 to overcome this problem. MetaBAT 2 uses a new adaptive binning algorithm to eliminate manual parameter tuning. We also performed extensive software engineering optimization to increase both computational and memory efficiency. Comparing MetaBAT 2 to alternative software tools on over 100 real world metagenome assemblies shows superior accuracy and computing speed. Binning a typical metagenome assembly takes only a few minutes on a single commodity workstation. We therefore recommend the community adopts MetaBAT 2 for their metagenome binning experiments. MetaBAT 2 is open source software and available at <uri xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat">https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat</uri>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Metagenomics</kwd><kwd>Metagenome binning</kwd><kwd>Clustering</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research</funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>China Scholarship Council (CSC)</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>Dongwan Kang, Edward Kirton, Ashleigh Thomas, Rob Egan, and Zhong Wang&#x02019;s work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Advances in computational metagenomics have produced tools that assemble billions of short sequence reads derived from deep metagenome sequencing into larger fragments (contigs), and subsequently group them into draft genomes by metagenome binning (reviewed in <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Kang, Rubin &#x00026; Wang, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recently we have witnessed exciting progress in metagenome binning as several automatic binning tools have become available. Our group developed MetaBAT (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2015</xref>) in 2015, among a few others developed around the same time, including MyCC (<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Lin &#x00026; Liao, 2016</xref>), MaxBin 2.0 (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Wu, Simmons &#x00026; Singer, 2015</xref>), MetaWatt-3.5 (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Strous et al., 2012</xref>) and CONCOCT (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Alneberg et al., 2014</xref>). These binning software tools have achieved various extents of success with simulated data or real world data. However, in practice the quality of binning experiments is largely dependent on characteristics of the underlying dataset and hence the choice of binning parameters. Our users and ourselves both independently observed that MetaBAT&#x02019;s binning performance can vary greatly among different parameter choices. As there are no established parameter optimization methods, to get a comprehensive binning result one has to run multiple binning experiments with different sets of parameters followed by merging the results. For example, in a recent large scale study of over 1,500 metagenome datasets, 8,000 draft genomes were obtained by merging five MetaBAT binning results, each derived from a different parameter set (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Parks et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the recent critical assessment of metagenome interpretation (CAMI) metagenome binning challenge (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Sczyrba et al., 2017</xref>), MetaBAT is the fastest and most robust software that can scale up to handle large metagenomic datasets with millions of contigs. Its accuracy was not the best, however, likely due to its lack of consistent binning performance toward various datasets. We therefore replaced the core binning algorithm with a completely new one and report MetaBAT 2 (the original MetaBAT hereafter referred as MetaBAT 1) in this study. The new algorithm consists of several new aspects: (1) normalized tetra-nucleotide frequency (TNF) scores, (2) a graph structure and an iterative graph partitioning procedure for clustering and (3) additional steps to recruit smaller contigs. In addition, we greatly improve the computational efficiency so that the increase in calculations does not affect the program&#x02019;s scalability.</p><p>MetaBAT 2 has been packaged by the research community as a Bioconda package (<uri xlink:href="https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/metabat2/README.html">https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/metabat2/README.html</uri>) and as a standard APP on the DOE Knowledgebase platform (<uri xlink:href="https://kbase.us/applist/apps/metabat/run_metabat/release">https://kbase.us/applist/apps/metabat/run_metabat/release</uri>). A Docker image is also available (<uri xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com/r/metabat/metabat">https://hub.docker.com/r/metabat/metabat</uri>). There are numerous studies that have reported using MetaBAT 2 and its associated tools for successful large scale metagenomic analyses (<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Rinke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Bahram et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Pasolli et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we focus on describing how MetaBAT 2 works, while providing performance benchmarks on a few synthetic datasets and a large number of real world datasets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>The adaptive binning algorithm</title><p>MetaBAT 2 uses the same raw TNF and abundance (ABD) scores as those in MetaBAT 1.

A graph with contigs as nodes and their similarity as edges is constructed in two steps. During the first step, an initial graph is constructed by only using TNF scores. Since TNF scores usually are not very reliable, we only use strong TNF scores for the first stage graph. Here we also put a limit on the number of edges per node to reduce computation, a parameter that can be adjusted to control sensitivity/specificity.</p><p>The second step is an iterative procedure of graph building and graph partitioning. At each iteration, a subset of edges with the highest similarity scores (<italic>S</italic>) are incorporated into the above graph, followed by graph partitioning using a modified label propagation algorithm (LPA, (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Zhu &#x00026; Ghahramani, 2002</xref>)). We modified the LPA in two aspects: (1) we let the search order decided by edge strength so that the partitioning is deterministic rather than random; and (2) we use the previous round of partitioning results as the labels for the graph in the next round to speed up binning. In addition, we used Fisher&#x02019;s method to evaluate the most likely membership of a contig among multiple neighborhoods where the contig is connected to. It is particularly helpful when the sizes of neighborhoods are different. In applying the Fisher&#x02019;s method, we used 1 &#x02212; <italic>S</italic> as <italic>p</italic>-values so that strong scores represent strong probabilities of the connections.</p></sec><sec><title>Small contigs/bins recruiting</title><p>MetaBAT 1 by default uses contigs 2.5 kb or larger. As many metagenome assemblies contain smaller contigs, MetaBAT 2 includes an additional step to include small contigs (between 1 and 2.5 kb), as well as the contigs from small bins (&#x0003c;200 kb) if there are three or more samples in the dataset. In this additional step, a &#x0201c;free&#x0201d; contig is assigned to a specific bin where its average correlation to member contigs from that bin is larger than the average correlation among the contigs within the bin.</p></sec><sec><title>Metagenome assemblies used for benchmarking binning</title><p>Three synthetic datasets (Low-, Medium- and High-complexity, respectively) were downloaded from the CAMI website (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Sczyrba et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A total of 120 real world metagenome assemblies were obtained from The Integrated Microbial Genomes &#x00026; Microbiomes system (IMG/M: <uri xlink:href="https://img.jgi.doe.gov/m/">https://img.jgi.doe.gov/m/</uri>) (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). A complete list of the samples and their IMG access IDs are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Table S1</xref>. As most of the metagenomics studies today were done on single samples, all of these 120 datasets contain only a single sample. They covered a variety of different environments, therefore providing a realistic estimate of MetaBAT2&#x02019;s performance. It is worth noting that the performance of MetaBAT2 were severely impaired without coverage information from multiple samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Software tools used for benchmarking binning</title><p>The other software tools we used are their latest versions: CONCOCT 0.4.0, MaxBin 2.2.4, MyCC (Docker image 990210oliver/mycc.docker:v1), BinSanity v.0.2.6.4 and COCACOLA Python version (updated on March 5, 2017), respectively. All tools were run with their default parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Searching best parameters by a genetic algorithm</title><p>The genetic algorithm was performed using the following parameters: population size: 10, selection size: 3, mutation rate: 0.05, crossover rate: 0.01, minimum/maximum generations: 3/10, and binary tournament selection. To evaluate the performance of binning, we used the minimum information about metagenome-assembled genome standards described in (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Bowers et al., 2017</xref>). The number of high-quality putative genomes was used as the fitness score, where high-quality is defined as &#x02265;90% complete and &#x02264;5% contamination as determined by CheckM, &#x02265;18 tRNAs identified by tRNAscan-SE (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Lowe &#x00026; Eddy, 1997</xref>), and all three ribosomal subunits, found by cmsearch. While tRNA and rRNA annotations can be annotated just once per contig, CheckM (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Parks et al., 2015</xref>) must be run on each parameter set&#x02019;s results and is the time-limiting step.</p></sec><sec><title>Computational optimization</title><p>The above changes in the binning algorithm in MetaBAT 2 require significantly more computation than MetaBAT 1. To make MetaBAT 2 work well with similar computing resources in a comparable runtime, we implemented several computational optimization techniques to improve its resource efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Computing efficiency</title><p>In addition to the original multi-thread strategy in MetaBAT 1, we also applied a lower level optimization on CPU cache memory access. A typical CPU has only 8&#x02013;64 kb level-1 cache and 256 kb&#x02013;2 MB level-2 cache. When the data is bigger than the level-2 cache (e.g., TNF distance matrix), the data is kept in random-access memory that is much slower to access. We adopted a loop tiling threading model that divides the TNF distance matrix into many smaller &#x0201c;tiles&#x0201d; that fit into level-2 cache, and distributes the calculation of each tile among many threads. This optimization alone gains a 35% performance improvement over the original parallel code.</p></sec><sec><title>Memory efficiency</title><p>With thousands or even millions of contigs, the pair-wise distance matrix gets bigger and can take a large amount of memory. To avoid storing the entire matrix in RAM, we use a priority queue data structure to store only the top <italic>k</italic> strong links of every contig for iterative clustering. This method scaled down the memory usage from <italic>O</italic>(<italic>N</italic><sup>2</sup>) to <italic>O</italic>(<italic>N</italic>), at the cost of a few extra calculations. The parameter <italic>k</italic> will affect the sensitivity and specificity of binning results, as smaller <italic>k</italic> values lead to high specificity but low sensitivity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Accuracy benchmarks on synthetic and real world metagenome assemblies</title><p>During the first CAMI challenge, MetaBAT 1 was the fastest and most scalable software, but its accuracy was only average compared with CONCOCT, MyCC and MaxBin 2.0 (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Sczyrba et al., 2017</xref>). To test whether MetaBAT 2 improves binning accuracy, we benchmarked MetaBAT 2 by comparing it against MaxBin2, CONCOCT, and MyCC. In addition, we added BinSanity (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Graham, Heidelberg &#x00026; Tully, 2017</xref>) and COCACOLA (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2017</xref>), two new automatic binners developed after CAMI 1.0, for comparison. All the tools were run using their default parameters (Methods).</p><p>The CAMI metagenome datasets were simulated with different species complexity and genome sizes, consisting of reads from 700 microbial genomes including strain-level diversity and 600 plasmids and viruses (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Sczyrba et al., 2017</xref>). Three datasets were simulated at different complexity levels (high, medium and low complexity). To date, they represent the best benchmark datasets for metagenome binning with known ground truth. We therefore ran the above tools on these three datasets. We used the same accuracy measures as we did in MetaBAT 1, that is, number of genomes recovered at certain genome completeness (recall, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9) and certain precision (0.9 and 0.95) cutoffs. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig-1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.7359/fig-1</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Benchmark of several popular binning tools on CAMI challenge datasets.</title><p>The number of identified genomes are shown at two different precision levels, &#x02265;95% (A, C and D) or &#x02265;90% (B, D and F).

In the CAMI Low Complexity dataset, MetaBAT 2 recovers the most genomes at almost every completeness/precision cutoff, except that CONCOCT recovers one more genome at the 90% completeness cutoff. In the other two datasets with higher community complexity, MetaBAT 2 bins more genomes than any other tool tested at every threshold. The difference seems to be more pronounced when complexity increases. For example, at 90% completeness and 95% precision levels MetaBAT 2 recovers 333 out of 753 genomes (44.2%) from the CAMI High Complexity dataset, while the next best software, MaxBin2, only recovers 195 genomes (25.9%). These results suggest the adaptive binning algorithm implemented in MetaBAT 2 can adapt to very complex microbial communities.</p><p>We also carried out benchmarking experiments on real world metagenome datasets downloaded from IMG/M (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Markowitz et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>).

There are only three parameters that may affect binning accuracy: (1) maxEdges (the maximum number of edges a node can have when constructing the graph, a lower number should reduce computing time but may also reduce sensitivity); (2) maxP (percentage of high quality contigs included for binning, a higher number gives more sensitivity); and (3) minS (the minimum score of an edge kept for binning, a higher number gives more specificity).</p><p>We designed a genetic algorithm to attempt to optimize the above parameters using the IMG100 dataset (Methods). For each of the samples in this dataset, the genetic algorithm systematically explores the parameter space and attempts to find the best parameter set for this sample. In this experiment we only considered the high-quality genome bins for performance scoring (Methods). Among all the best parameter sets found from all samples, the default parameter set is selected to be the best for the majority (58%) of the samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Table S2</xref>). Comparing the next nine most frequently selected best parameter sets to the default one on all the samples showed that the default parameter set has a consistent performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). The genetic algorithm did find some parameter sets that are slightly better than the default on some samples under this scoring metric, although it significantly increased the total running time. Using a different scoring scheme or using a different set of testing data may select a different set of parameters, but the benefit over the default parameters appears to be very small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig-3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.7359/fig-3</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>A binning performance comparison between the default parameter set of MetaBAT 2 against several common best parameter sets found by the genetic algorithm.</title><p>The IMG100 dataset was used for searching for the best parameter set for each sample.

MetaBAT 2 finished binning in a few hours, but other tools took days even weeks, if they can finish. Some tools failed on some of the large assemblies after a long time probably due to their high memory requirement.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are a couple of considerations when using MetaBAT 2. First of all, MetaBAT 2 uses an adaptive binning algorithm which puts more weight on ABD but less weight on TNF, which makes it work well on datasets with multiple samples (CAMI synthetic sets, e.g.). In general we expect more samples to produce better accuracy. For single-sample datasets, some users reported a genome can sometimes be split among different bins in spite of consistent TNF composition. This illustrates that MetaBAT 2 weighs heavily on purity with some sacrifice in completeness. A manual, post-binning polishing step may be required to further improve completeness. A second consideration is that MetaBAT does not eliminate chimeric contigs or other artifacts from assembly, so binning results from very poor assemblies will not be reliable. Some post-binning polishing process, such as <italic>d</italic><sub>2</sub><sup>s</sup> Bin (<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), may help reduce the contamination problem.</p><p>The method of normalizing TNF and CORs using ABD makes it possible for future MetaBAT versions to incorporate additional scoring matrices in a similar fashion. Interestingly, in a recent preprint, <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Nissen et al. (2018)</xref> developed an alternative strategy based on deep variational autoencoders to accomplish a similar task and got very good results. Additional matrices could be taxonomic similarity, physical linkage (provided by Hi-C experiments or paired end reads), and/or other similarity matrices of the contigs. Incorporating taxonomic information would provide a framework to unite taxonomy dependent and independent binning strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we show that the adoption of a new adaptive binning algorithm makes MetaBAT 2 automatically adapt to datasets with various characteristics and provides robust metagenome binning. This should greatly reduce users&#x02019; time needed to manually explore the underlying datasets and experiment with different parameter sets. This capability should be particularly useful for datasets derived from unknown complex microbial communities, as empirically setting parameters might be challenging. Extensive low-level computational optimization taking advantage of the underlying hardware capabilities also makes MetaBAT 2 run very efficiently, and makes it scalable for very large datasets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title>Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.7359/supp-1</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 1</label><caption><title>A list of metagenome assemblies used to evaluate binning performance.</title><p>IMG access IDs and Sample names for IMG-100 dataset.</p></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-07-7359-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.7359/supp-2</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 2</label><caption><title>List of parameter sets to evaluate MetaBAT2 on 120 real metagenome assemblies.</title><p>The parameter sets and their performance comparison to the default parameter set.</p></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-07-7359-s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.7359/supp-3</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 3</label><caption><title>Table S3.</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-07-7359-s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional Information and Declarations</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><title>Competing Interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conflict-1"><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contributions"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-1"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-1">Dongwan D.
