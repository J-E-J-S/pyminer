Therefore, discovering these cancer pathways and their dysregulation order is key to understanding and treating cancer. However, the heterogeneity of mutations between different individuals makes this challenging and requires that cancer progression is studied in a subtype-specific way. To address this challenge, we provide a mathematical model, called Subtype-specific Pathway Linear Progression Model (SPM), that simultaneously captures cancer subtypes and pathways and order of dysregulation of the pathways within each subtype. Experiments with synthetic data indicate the robustness of SPM to problem specifics including noise compared to an existing method. Moreover, experimental results on glioblastoma multiforme and colorectal adenocarcinoma show the consistency of SPM&#x02019;s results with the existing knowledge and its superiority to an existing method in certain cases. The implementation of our method is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Dalton386/SPM">https://github.com/Dalton386/SPM</ext-link>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Different biological processes within a cell are performed through biological pathways. A biological pathway consists of a group of proteins and other molecules and complex interactions between them. It is known that cancer arises due to malfunction, also known as dysregulation, of one or more pathways. Interestingly, a dysregulation in a patient is often caused by mutations in only one (and not more) molecule in the pathway. This phenomenon is known as mutual exclusivity of mutations and can be used for identification of groups of genes forming (cancer) pathways. The same type of cancer in different patients can result due to different trajectories of dysregulations in possibly different pathways resulting in cancer heterogeneity. Cancer heterogeneity implies that cancer treatment should be personalized according to each patient&#x02019;s specific characteristics and mutations. Therefore, grouping patients based on their pathway dysregulation trajectories into cancer subtypes can help identify different cancer mechanisms, inform subtype-specific treatment strategies and improve efficacy. In this paper, we provide a method that uses patients&#x02019; mutation information captured by DNA sequencing and identifies dysregulated pathways (i.e. molecules involved in each cancer pathway), cancer subtypes (i.e. groups of patients sharing a common pathway dysregulation trajectory) and subtype-specific pathway dysregulation orders (i.e. trajectories defining the different subtypes). The results on synthetic and real-world data indicate that the method can recover meaningful information about the progression of cancer in different groups of patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>PLOS Publication Stage</meta-name><meta-value>vor-update-to-uncorrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>Publication Update</meta-name><meta-value>2019-11-21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The COAD and GBM data used in this research are respectively provided in DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1038/nature11252">10.1038/nature11252</ext-link> and DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1038/nature07385">10.1038/nature07385</ext-link> and are publicly available from cBioPortal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/">http://www.cbioportal.org/</ext-link>).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The COAD and GBM data used in this research are respectively provided in DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1038/nature11252">10.1038/nature11252</ext-link> and DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1038/nature07385">10.1038/nature07385</ext-link> and are publicly available from cBioPortal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/">http://www.cbioportal.org/</ext-link>).</p></notes></front><body><disp-quote><p>This is a <italic>PLOS Computational Biology</italic> Methods paper.</p></disp-quote><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well understood that human tumors develop over an extended time period through the accumulation of genetic mutations. Thanks to the advancements in DNA sequencing technologies, we now have an increasing amount of high quality genomic data for studying the trajectories of cancer mutations (e.g. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Two intriguing questions for these studies are: (1) Which mutations are crucial for tumor development, and which are not? In other words, what are the so called &#x0201c;driver&#x0201d; mutations and which mutations are only &#x0201c;passengers&#x0201d;? (2) Is there any meaningful temporal pattern for the driver mutations and how can we infer it if it exists? While the first problem can be solved in part by comparing observed frequencies of mutations across different patients [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the second problem concerning the temporal order of mutations remains challenging. This is because most of the existing genomic datasets contain cross-sectional data taken from single samples across different individuals and not longitudinal data. Moreover, solving the second problem can provide insights into the relative importance of the driver mutations (i.e. the earlier the mutation time, the more important the mutation).</p><p>A number of studies have focused on inferring the temporal order of single mutations in different cancers. These works can be categorized into two main classes. The first class consists of methods based on sequencing data from a single individual. Some of the earlier methods in this class used bulk sequencing data from a single sample (<italic>e.g</italic>. rec-BTP [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], CTPsingle [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]) or multiple samples from the same tumor or patient (<italic>e.g</italic>. PhyloWGS [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], AncesTree [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], LICHeE [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], CITUP [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). The latest developments are based on single-cell data (<italic>e.g</italic>. OncoNEM [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], SCITE [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], SiFit [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) or simultaneously utilize single-cell and bulk sequencing to create synergy between the two data types (B-SCITE [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and PhISCS [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]).</p><p>The second class contains methods based on sequencing data from several individuals. Unlike the methods of the first class, ensemble level methods mostly use binarized cross-sectional mutation data indicating whether the mutation has occurred or not. The first work in this class models the relationship between the mutations as a linear path [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This was followed by the idea of a phylogenetic tree among the mutations (e.g. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Other works consider different possible evolutionary trajectories for subsets of individuals and infer a mixture of trees (e.g. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Others have used a probabilistic graphical model with mutations as the variables to allow for later convergence of mutations (e.g. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]), which is not possible in a tree model. A recent publication using an ensemble approach [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] leveraged non-binary cancer cell fraction data which provides more information about the timing of mutations.</p><p>Because the above methods work at the level of single mutation or gene, they are challenged by the extensive heterogeneity in the mutation data, which results in weak temporal patterns. This heterogeneity is associated with the fact that somatic mutations target specific biological pathways [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. &#x0201c;A biological pathway is a series of actions among molecules in a cell that leads to a certain product or a change in the cell. Such a pathway can trigger the assembly of new molecules, such as a fat or protein. Pathways can also turn genes on and off, or spur a cell to move&#x0201d;. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Pathways can be dysregulated due to the mutation of any of their critical member genes. This results in different individuals having mutations on different genes of the same pathway. Based on this observation, cancer is modulated by dysregulation of pathways and the relevant order of mutations might be at the level of pathways not genes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This approach decreases the challenges associated with the heterogeneity of mutations across individuals.</p><p>Some previous work has been done on the detection of temporal patterns in pathway dysregulations. Some of these approaches (e.g. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), which demonstrate advantages over gene-based methods, are based on the known pathways (e.g. KEGG [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). Since most annotated pathways are large and overlap with other pathways, they are inapplicable for the discoveries of mutation progression in smaller sets of interacting genes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One alternative is to discover pathways <italic>de novo</italic>. Raphael and Vandin [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] proposed a method to simultaneously infer pathways and the timing relation between them. They hypothesized that tumor development is driven by a linear sequence of pathway dysregulations and proposed the Pathway Linear Progression Model (PLPM). PLPM exploits a property known as mutual exclusivity, which is first mentioned in [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and indicates that an individual is unlikely to have more than one mutation in a particular pathway. Mutual exclusivity has also been used to successfully identify pathways in cancer datasets [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To find the optimal PLPM model for the observed cross-sectional sequencing data represented in a binary format, an integer linear program is used. Later, Cristea <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] relaxed the linear progression assumption of PLPM in their method called pathTiMEx. They provided a probabilistic graphical model that captures mutual exclusivity as well as the complex progression models. It generalizes both TiMEx [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which finds mutually exclusive sets of genes, and Conjunctive Bayesian Networks [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which identifies partial orders of mutations.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of PLPM and pathTiMEx is limited because of their simplifying assumptions. Firstly, they assume that all individuals follow the same progression model of pathway dysregulation, but different cancer subtypes have been widely observed in cancer patients [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Within the context of cancer analysis, subtypes refer to &#x0201c;the smaller groups that a type of cancer can be divided into, based on certain characteristics of the cancer cells&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Some recent biological studies (e.g. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]) have indicated a relationship between differences in observed phenotypes and differences in temporal orders of mutations, which implies the possible subtype-specificity of the temporal pattern of mutations. Hence, by assuming a single progression model for all individuals, subtype-specific information from input profiles is lost in the PLPM approach and the risk of making biased inference increases. Secondly, PLPM and pathTiMEx assume binary mutation profiles and cannot exploit the additional information that sequencing technologies (e.g. bulk sequencing) can provide about the temporal order of mutations (e.g. Cancer Cell Fractions (CCFs) extracted from read count data).</p><p>In this work, we also assume linear progression among pathways and irreversible mutations (a mutation is inherited by all descendent cells after it occurs in a cell) as in PLPM. To address the aforementioned drawbacks, we relax other assumptions of the PLPM model and propose a novel model, called the Subtype-specific Pathway Linear Progression Model (SPM), that (1) detects different cancer subtypes and their corresponding progression models and (2) exploits CCFs extracted from read count data. In our method, cancer subtypes are captured by the notion of tumor lineage. That is, the subtype of a tumor is identified by clustering the pathway dysregulation orders of individual tumors. We also use the concept of mutual exclusivity for detecting the pathways. However, we incorporate non-binary data providing more information for inference of pathway dysregulation order and allowing for stronger enforcement of mutual exclusivity between more important mutations, i.e. mutations that appear earlier. Last, but not least, our model can employ both binary and continuous sequencing data, which increases the versatility and accuracy of the model.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we define the problem of finding the optimal SPM from mutation profiles. Then, an Integer Linear Program solution is provided. Finally, the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments with two real cancer datasets.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Problem definition</title><p>In a SPM problem, we are given:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>An <italic>m</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>n</italic> mutation matrix <italic>C</italic>, with samples on the rows and genes on the columns, where <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> is the Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF) of gene <italic>j</italic> in sample <italic>i</italic>. CCF of a variant denotes the proportion of cancer cells in a sample that harbour that variant. For a single nucleotide variation (SNV) locus with neutral copy number, the CCF is computed as <inline-formula id="pcbi.1007451.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1007451.e001.jpg" id="pcbi.1007451.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <italic>v</italic> and <italic>r</italic> are respectively the number of variant and reference read counts mapped to an area covering that locus. This computation is assuming a sample purity of 1, otherwise the read counts should be corrected based on the known purity by reducing the value of <italic>r</italic>. If the sample purity values are not known, CCF values can be replaced with Variant Allele Frequency values computed as <inline-formula id="pcbi.1007451.e002"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1007451.e002.jpg" id="pcbi.1007451.e002g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>. For loci with copy number variation (CNV), computation of CCF is very difficult and associated with uncertainty. Therefore, we do not consider loci with CNV regardless of occurrence of SNV in the locus.

The accuracy of identified subtypes and pathways is measured by the Rand index between the ground-truth clusters and the methods&#x02019; outputs. With respect to detecting the correct progression order, we used 1&#x02013;Kendall tau distance to measure the similarity between the ground-truth orders and methods&#x02019; outputs. Because there are multiple orders for different subtypes, we first associate each output subtype and pathway to its corresponding most overlapping ground-truth subtype and pathway. For SPM, for each identified subtype, we compute the Kendall tau distance with the order of the corresponding ground-truth subtype and take the average over all subtypes. For, PLPM, because it does not produce subtypes, we report the value for the ground-truth order with the maximum similarity. In cases with more than one solutions, we take the mean of the mentioned measures over all solutions.</p><p>The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007451.g002">Fig 2</xref>. As expected, because PLPM does not detect subtypes, the Rand index of its outputs is always smaller than SPM. SPM performs an almost perfect subtyping and pathway detection in most of the experiments. SPM outperforms PLPM in detecting pathways because of its ability to consider multiple different progression orders for different subtypes. Moreover, in presence of higher noise, binary data results in worse performance for PLPM as it assigns similar weights to small (uncertain) and large (certain) CCFs. The pathways and their order detected by PLPM are also more sensitive to the number of provided samples <italic>m</italic> and PLPM require more samples to detect the correct pathways and an order matching progression of one of the subtypes. PLPM can detect one of the subtype progression orders in three cases: 1) with 2 subtypes, because, compared to 3 subtypes, there are more samples per subtype and less number of conflicting progression orders, 2) 4 subtypes, because the particular random example generated for this case had very similar progression orders across different subtypes and 3) low noise, because of small number of false positives. However, PLPM does not assign the genes to the pathways as accurate as SPM does in those cases.</p><fig id="pcbi.1007451.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007451.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Results of sensitivity analysis using synthetic data.</title><p>Note that each graphs might have different scales for the vertical axes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1007451.g002"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Real data results</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Datasets</title><p>We evaluated our method by applying it to two datasets from TCGA containing somatic mutation data from patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As described earlier, we used CCF values as opposed to the binarized data used in previous works. This enables us infer more about the proper ordering of mutations but limited us to only somatic mutation information as copy number variation data would reduce the accuracy of the analysis. Although there are tools for inferring the CCF values for copy number variations (e.g. PyClone [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]), their accuracy is limited for low-coverage cross-sectional data, including the two datasets we investigated. Therefore, we opted to filter out any sample that had a copy number variation in any of genes of the panels we studied. This filtering avoids the type of bias that can be caused by ignoring CNVs that indeed exist in a patient. Although this process reduces sample size and limits our biological conclusions to the relationships between SNVs, the implications are still interesting with respect to the cancer progression and involved mutations.</p><p>Moreover, all weak signals including the loci with total read count less than 20, variant read count less than 10, or CCF smaller than 0.05 were considered false positives and were eliminated.

However, the optimality gaps computed by CPLEX for the presented results, which were respectively &#x0223c;13% and &#x0223c;0% for COAD and GBM datasets, indicate that the solutions are near optimal.

In three out of four cases, SPM groups together two or more genes from a known pathway and is reasonably good at separating pathways from each other. Where SPM struggles is in grouping the PI3K pathway genes together, spreading them across identified pathways. Despite this, SPM excels in preserving the mutual exclusivity of the pathways, with no violations of this property in any of the cases. This is due to the freedom of having multiple subtypes. In contrast, PLPM violates the mutual exclusivity property in 10 cases, equating to &#x0223c;14%, for the first pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007451.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The reason for this is that the first pathway that PLPM identifies contains 12 genes that correspond to multiple (at least four) known biological pathways. Thus it is highly probably that two genes from this pathway will be altered in the same sample, therefore violating the mutual exclusivity property.</p><fig id="pcbi.1007451.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007451.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Results for GBM using SPM (left) and PLPM (right).</title><p>Genes within the same known pathway are coded by the same color.

Raphael and Vandin [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] made the argument that <italic>TP53</italic> mutations occur before <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, in contrast to previous reports for COAD but in line with more recent work on other cancer types. Although their progression supported this hypothesis, it is in conflict with the high CCF values for <italic>KRAS</italic> in some samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007451.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In 88 cases (&#x02248; 67%), the progression from PLPM does not match the ordering of the CCF values, whereas SPM does not suffer from this issue due to its hard constraints. Our resulting subtypes are in agreement with the CCF values and suggest that the ordering of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> is perhaps more variable than once thought, with <italic>KRAS</italic> preceeding <italic>TP53</italic> in subtypes 1 and 4 and <italic>TP53</italic> preceeding <italic>KRAS</italic> in subtypes 2 and 3. Finding a single progression based on binarized data and not CCF values limits this kind of inquiry.</p><p>The resulting subtypes for COAD failed to show any meaningful difference in the survival analysis, unlike the GBM results. However, the subtypes did show some separation when aligned to the tumour stage, a clinical variable included in the COAD dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007451.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Subtype 3 appears to be more prevalent in stage iiib compared to other subtypes, indicating that subtype 3 maybe be more agressive than the other subtypes. This is further supported by the fact that subtype 3 is characterized by a high frequency of mutations with large CCF values in <italic>TP53</italic>, a major driver in all cancers but especially crucial in COAD progression where <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis [<xref rid="pcbi.1007451.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These results suggest that these identified subtypes may be informative for categorizing samples according to tumour stage and predicting patient outcomes.</p><fig id="pcbi.1007451.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007451.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Prevalence of each identified COAD subtype in different disease stages.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1007451.g007"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Methods</title><p>We propose an integer linear program to solve the SPM problem, which simultaneously optimizes pathways, cancer subtypes, and subtype-specific pathway linear progression.

The underlying assumptions are mutual exclusivity of mutations within each pathway, the correlation between CCF value and mutation timing, and the subtype-specificity of cancer progression. Based on experiments with 9 synthetic datasets, SPM is very robust against different problem specifics, such as the number of patients, subtypes and pathways and data noise, while PLPM is sensitive to these factors. Based on experiments with two real datasets, namely GBM and COAD, the detected subtypes correlated to the clinical attributes such as survival and tumor stage. Additionally, the discovered pathways contained genes known to be related to each other. The relative importance of the pathways in different subtypes with respect to the progression models was consistent with the existing knowledge. In some cases, the pathways detected by the SPM were more informative than the pathways identified by an existing model, namely PLPM.</p><p>As an NP-Hard problem, similar to PLPM, the ILP solution for SPM is hindered by factors such as quality of the input data and available computational power. This also restricts the number of genes and samples that can be included in the input. Therefore, employing alternative optimization methods is a new direction for future work. Moreover, extending the model to automatically select a subset of the input genes (e.g. based on mutual exclusivity) to be included in the progression inference can increase the generality of SPM. Although the proposed model is applicable to both SNVs and CNVs, this study was restricted to SNVs due to the limitation of current technology for computing CCF values in presence of CNVs. This limitation should be addressed in future work as the required technology becomes available.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pcbi.1007451.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">

The authors show that this problem is NP-hard and introduce an ILP which they run on real data.</p><p>I have reviewed the initial submission to RECOMB-CCB. My previous concerns/comments have been satisfactorily addressed. The journal version of the manuscript contains a clearer problem statement, sensitivity analysis using simulated data, and various revisions to clarify exposition, hardness proof and overall presentation of results. I have no further comments. This well-written manuscript will be of interest to the readership of this journal.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Building on a previously established Integer Linear program (PLPM) (see ref. [1]), in this study Khakabimamghani et al. have introduced a new method, called SPM to address the reconstruction of the temporal order of pathway dysregulation. They have extended the previous work (see ref. [1]) by using CCF values instead of binarized data and also, they have taken the subtype specificity of cancer progression into account in their formulation of the integer linear program. While their focus on the subtype-specificity of cancer progression is much appreciated, I have major issues with the originality/novelty of their methodology and the solidity of their results. Therefore, although I do not see the potential to recommend this work for publication in PLOS Computational Biology, I am pretty sure that it may warrant publication in an alternative journal (e.g. PLOS One), provided the major concerns are adequately addressed.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Comment #1:</p><p>I appreciate the authors attempt to include subtype-specificity of cancer progression in reconstruction of the ordering of cancer pathway dysregulation, which has resulted in some improvements (particularly in the simulation results) as compared to the previous study (see ref [1]). However, I have the impression that their framework is very similar to the previous work and so to my view, it is not sufficiently novel. Moreover, as the authors have clearly acknowledged in the conclusion:</p><p>&#x0201c;Due to the complexity of SPM, finding the optimal solution is hindered by factors such as quality of the input data and available computational power. This also restricts the number of genes and samples that can be included in SPM&#x02019;s input. Therefore, employing alternative optimization methods is a new direction for future work.&#x0201d;</p><p>the method seems to suffer from complexity issues that is not well-addressed in this study.</p><p>Comment #2:</p><p>Although based on their sensitivity analysis using synthetic data, the authors have shown that their method more accurately assigns genes to pathways and more consistently reconstructs their ordering (as summarized in figure 2), their analysis of real dataset, which is exactly the same as the ones used in the previous study (see ref [1]), does not provide conclusive evidence regarding the advantage of including the subtype-specificity of cancer progression. This is acknowledged by the authors in multiple paragraphs in their Real Data Results section:</p><p>&#x0201c;Where SPM struggles is in grouping the PI3K pathway genes together, spreading them across identified pathways. This could potentially be due to the solution being sub-optimal as a result of insufficient data and model complexity&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;The separation of genes into their known biological pathways, as defined in [43], is less clear with the COAD dataset, with genes being spread across the identified pathways.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;There is no clear advantage of any of the four identified progressions compared to the progression from PLMP, as they all struggle to fully recapitulate the true pathways, and are fairly similar, in regards to their identified pathways.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;The resulting subtypes for COAD failed to show any meaningful difference in the survival analysis, unlike the GBM results.&#x0201d;</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Comment #3:</p><p>In the problem definition, the authors mention that: &#x0201c;For loci with copy number variation (CNV), computation of CCF is very difficult and associated with uncertainty. Therefore, we do not consider loci with CNV regardless of occurrence of SNV in the locus&#x0201d;</p><p>Would the authors comment on what is the prevalence of loci with CNV? Completely ignoring loci with CNV might have the potential to strongly bias the entire analyses. I therefore recommend the authors to clearly discuss this major issue in the conclusion or discussion section and provide quantitative data to ensure that ignoring loci with CNV data does not strongly mislead the results.</p><p>Comment #4:</p><p>In page 4, variables tau (&#x00393;) and Z are introduced respectively as: &#x0201c;&#x00393; as the sum of CCFs of genes within pathway x and Z as the corresponding CCF value of pathway x for sample I based on the CCFs of the genes belonging to x (described later) &#x0201d;. The language is very unclear and according to these definitions, these two variables are almost indistinguishable. I suspect that they are used with different notation in equation (2) in page 12, where apparently the first term (equivalent of tau (&#x00393;)) represents the &#x0201c;observed&#x0201d; CCF profiles and the second term (equivalent of Z) is the CCF profile &#x0201c;predicted&#x0201d; by SPM. I strongly recommend using the same language and notations in both places to avoid major confusions.</p><p>Comment #5:</p><p>In the real data analyses, the authors have used exactly the same dataset as in (see ref [1]), which is focused only on glioblastoma multiforme and colorectal cancer. To prove the superiority of their method, analyses of alternative real datasets (including different cancer types) are required. At least, analysis of an alternative colorectal cancer dataset (see ref [2]) is necessary, which can help the authors to see whether their conclusions regarding colorectal cancer is robust and reproducible in different datasets?</p><p>Comment #6:</p><p>In page 8, it is mentioned that &#x0201c;However, based on an empirical test for one of the experiments (not shown) and optimality gaps of ~13% and 0% respectively for COAD nad GBM datasets, the results are expected to be near optimal, if not optimal.&#x0201d;. Please include the (not shown) results at least in the supplementary section.</p><p>Comment #7:</p><p>Please provide a more informative caption for the figure 4.</p><p>Comment #8:</p><p>In page 9, it is mentioned that &#x0201c;Additionally, all detected subtypes map well (Rand index =0.68) onto the five subtypes of GBM described in [52].&#x0201d;</p><p>It would be helpful, if the authors include a measure of the significance of the Rand index, for example the p-value quantified by cc_test_ari function in CrossClustering R package (see ref [3]).</p><p>Comment #9:</p><p>In page 9 it is written &#x0201c;&#x02026; and thus drugs that target early mutations should be more effective&#x0201d;. The logic behind this conclusion is not easy to follow, instead it seems to be highly speculative. I recommend avoiding such sentences at least in the results section.</p><p>Comment #10:</p><p>In the main text, Figure 4b is discussed after figure 5. The reordering of the figures accordingly may be required.</p><p>Comment #11:</p><p>In the conclusions section in page 12, the authors conclude that</p><p>&#x0201c;Based on experiments with two real datasets, namely GBM and COAD, the detected subtypes correlated to the clinical attributes such as survival and tumor stage.&#x0201d;</p><p>I realized that this conclusion is untrue as it contradicts the author&#x02019;s own results, which was previously described as:</p><p>&#x0201c;The resulting subtypes for COAD failed to show any meaningful difference in the survival analysis, unlike the GBM results.&#x0201d;.</p><p>Comment #12:</p><p>In the conclusions section in page 12, the authors conclude that &#x0201c;The relative importance of the pathways in different subtypes with respect to the progression models was consistent with the existing knowledge.&#x0201d;</p><p>I realized that this conclusion is also untrue as it contradicts the author&#x02019;s own results, which was previously described as:</p><p>&#x0201c;The separation of genes into their known biological pathways, as defined in [43], is less clear with the COAD dataset, with genes being spread across the identified pathways.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;There is no clear advantage of any of the four identified progressions compared to the progression from PLMP, as they all struggle to fully recapitulate the true pathways, and are fairly similar, in regards to their identified pathways.&#x0201d;</p><p>Comment #13:</p><p>The last sentence of the conclusions in page 13 is too general and to my view is far beyond the scope of what this work has achieved: &#x0201c;The proposed framework provides a basis for gaining insight into the biology of cancer and its treatment as sequencing technologies advance, the quality of data increases, and larger datasets become available&#x0201d;.</p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Raphael BJ, Vandin F.
