Gene alterations in the cancer genome form genetic interactions, which affect the response of patients to drugs. We developed an algorithm that mines copy number alteration and whole-exome mutation profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), as well as functional screen data generated to identify potential genetic interactions for specific cancer types. As a result, 4,529 synthetic viability (SV) interactions and 10,637 synthetic lethality (SL) interactions were detected. The pharmacogenomic datasets revealed that SV interactions induced drug resistance in cancer cells and that SL interactions mediated drug sensitivity in cancer cells. Deletions of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>DVL1</italic>, both of which participate in the Notch signaling pathway, had an SV effect in cancer cells, and deletion of <italic>DVL1</italic> induced resistance to <italic>HDAC1</italic> inhibitors in cancer cells. In addition, patients with low expression of both <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>DVL1</italic> had poor prognosis.

Thus, besides SL interactions, the present work identified and analyzed SV interactions in cancer cells using The Cancer&#x000a0;Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer genome data and validating by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), CRISPR, and yeast datasets.

Reliable co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity interactions were then selected from functional screening data, including shRNA and CRISPR datasets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). The strategy was based on the notion that knockdown of one gene causes a selective enhancement (SV) or reduction (SL) in cell viability, with simultaneous alterations&#x000a0;in another gene. In addition, the positive and negative interactions in yeast genetic interactions were also used to infer SV and SL relationships in human cancer cells, respectively. Ultimately, the co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity gene pairs verified in at least one type of dataset (shRNA, CRISPR, or yeast) were selected as candidate genetic interactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C).

Moreover, network analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were performed to investigate the functional relationship between genes with genetic interactions.

For SV interactions, if one gene was targeted by a particular drug, the drug response measures (IC<sub>50</sub> or AUC) in cell lines with alterations of the partner gene were significantly higher than those in the cell lines with the wild-type (WT) partner gene.
