PTGS is an ubiquitous basic biological phenomenon involved in the regulation of transcript abundance and plants&#x02019; immune response to viruses. PTGS also mediates genomic stability by silencing of retroelements. RNAi has become an important research tool for studying gene function by strong and selective suppression of target genes. Here, we present <bold>si-Fi</bold>, a software tool for design optimization of RNAi constructs necessary for specific target gene knock-down. It offers efficiency prediction of RNAi sequences and off-target search, required for the practical application of RNAi. <bold>si-Fi</bold> is an open-source (CC BY-SA license) desktop software that works in Microsoft Windows environment and can use custom sequence databases in standard FASTA format.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>si-Fi</kwd><kwd>RNA interface</kwd><kwd>off-target</kwd><kwd>RNAi design</kwd><kwd>RNAi efficiency prediction</kwd><kwd>posttranscriptional gene silencing</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="64"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="5607"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>High-throughput gene silencing technologies were applied in several organisms to study gene function. Although the novel technique of CRISPR/Cas9-directed site-specific mutagenesis is attracting wide scientific interest, RNAi still offers advantages. RNAi is able to target any transcript regardless of ploidy, and it is not hampered by chromatin structure modifications (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Uusi-Makela et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the RNAi-mediated silencing is quantitative (knockdown) and can be directed to tissue or developmental specificity by the utilization of the respective promoter. As this application is based on sequence similarity of the silencing trigger to the respective targets, it allows silencing of several gene family members with a unique construct.</p><p>RNAi can be used for stable as well as for transient transgene-mediated gene silencing based on the mechanism of posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Unniyampurath et al., 2016</xref>). PTGS is an essential part of plant immune response to viruses (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Muhammad et al., 2019</xref>) and required for genomic stability by silencing of retroelements (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Almeida and Allshire, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the hallmark of posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS). These small RNAs, usually 21 nucleotides (nt) in length, mediate the sequence specificity and represent the active principle of successful gene silencing (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Zamore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Elbashir et al., 2001</xref>). They are generated by a DICER-mediated cleavage of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into 19&#x02013;25 base pair (bp) long double-stranded oligonucleotides with 2-nt 3&#x02019;overhangs. A sequence asymmetry-sensing mechanism is selecting one strand to be incorporated into an ARGONAUT-containing complex named RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Khvorova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Amarzguioui and Prydz, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Ui-Tei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Frank et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Walton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Noland et al., 2011</xref>). The mRNA targets are then found by nucleotide pairing between the antisense (guide) strand of the AGO-incorporated siRNA on the one side and the target mRNA on the other. This interaction is probably influenced&#x02014;besides other factors&#x02014;by the physical accessibility and presence of unpaired nucleotides at the RNA target site (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ameres et al., 2007</xref>). Once the guide siRNA chain of the silencing complex is paired to the target mRNA molecule, the latter will be hydrolyzed, and thus, the expression of the corresponding gene will be knocked down (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hammond et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>RNAi has become widely used as a tool to modulate gene expression. A vast amount of experimental data has been accumulated, which allows design and validation of RNAi prediction models (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">McGinnis, 2010</xref>). Several publicly available software tools, mainly intended for their use in mammals, are described for the design of dsRNA silencing inducers (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Naito and Ui-Tei, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). Also, software from commercial distributors is available [e.g., siRNA Wizard Software 3.1, InvivoGen (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2009</xref>) or BLOCK-iT&#x02122; RNAi Designer, Thermofisher (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chung et al., 2017</xref>)]. In mammals, long double-stranded RNA molecules are known to induce strong interferon reactions and cell death (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957</xref>). Therefore, the intention in animal and human research is to use short double-stranded oligonucleotides for triggering the silencing. This also influenced the development of experimental techniques and software tools. Due to the absence of the interferon response in plants, the use of long double-stranded RNA as a trigger of RNA is possible. However, data on the experimental validation of several different constructs used for silencing in plants are more limited.</p><p>In order to validate the presented <bold>si-Fi</bold> algorithm, we performed experiments to test the algorithm output. The experimental system is based on transient transformation protocols <italic>via</italic> particle bombardment of barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> spp. <italic>vulgare</italic>) leaf segments. In our experimental approach, specific genes are targeted to improve the resistance against barley powdery mildew pathogen <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei (Bgh)</italic>. Barley and <italic>Bgh</italic> represent a plant&#x02013;pathogen system with a model character due to a large body of published phytopathological, genetic, physiological, and molecular data (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Huckelhoven and Panstruga, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bindschedler et al., 2016</xref>). Cultivated barley is among the most important crop plants worldwide. Besides its agronomic importance, barley is an established model organism of the <italic>Triticeae</italic> tribe of grasses. It has a large amount of genetic and genomic resources, large <italic>ex situ</italic> germplasm collections, breeding knowledge, and a well-annotated genome (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">de Carvalho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Milner et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> is an obligate biotrophic <italic>Acomycota</italic> fungus with extreme host specificity [split up into so-called <italic>formae speciales</italic> (f. sp.) e.g. <italic>hordei</italic> for barley]. The genome sequence information is available (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Spanu et al., 2010</xref>). Fungal development is fast and synchronous with entirely epiphytic hyphal growth on leaf or stem surfaces. The prerequisite of a successful fungal infection is the generation of a haustorium. Haustoria (specialized nutrient-uptake cells) are localized inside the host epidermal layer. In our study, we scored the plant susceptibility by observing the first and most critical step in this interaction&#x02014;the establishment of the first fungal haustorium in the host cell.</p><p>In barley, one of the best studied resistance genes for powdery mildew is <italic>HvMlo</italic> (HORVU4Hr1G082710). <italic>HvMlo</italic> was identified as a functional genetic component in the resistance mediating Mildew locus O (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Jorgensen, 1992</xref>) and encodes a seven-transmembrane domain protein (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Buschges et al., 1997</xref>), representing a susceptibility factor of the basal plant defense reactions (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Appiano et al., 2015</xref>). The 4,388-bp long gene contains a coding region of 3,145 bp with 12 exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">
<bold>Supplementary Figure S1</bold>
</xref>). The annotated 5&#x02019;UTR consists of 450 bases and the 3&#x02019;UTR of 1,100 bases. Functional repression of the gene by silencing or complete knockout confers strong and broad-spectrum resistance to <italic>Bgh</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Acevedo-Garcia et al., 2014</xref>). As the response is restricted to a limited number of transiently transformed epidermal cells, the molecular silencing effect, i.e., reduction of <italic>HvMlo</italic> mRNA abundance, is difficult to detect. Therefore, <italic>Bgh</italic> resistance represents an easy readout phenotype for efficient silencing of the <italic>HvMlo</italic> gene (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Douchkov et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>HvMloH1</italic> (HORVU4Hr1G082760, GenBank Acc. Nr. Z95496.1) shows high sequence similarity to the <italic>HvMlo</italic> gene (about 85% identity) and potentially originates from a gene duplication. It can therefore be considered as potential off-target of the <italic>HvMlo</italic> gene. The functional information on this gene is very limited. The gene seems to be expressed to a very low level, only detectable in senescing leaves (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Mascher et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present an approach to address the questions of RNAi specificity and design optimization by means of computer-aided prediction followed by experimental validation based on RNAi of the <italic>HvMlo</italic> gene and host resistance as indirect readout of RNAi efficiency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>DNA Constructs and Cloning</title><p>Synthetic DNA sequences (500 bp: 1,275 to 1,774 nucleotides from the coding region of NCBI GenBank Acc.

Each fragment is then unwound by helicases into two single RNA strands, where only one of the strands (guide strand) is incorporated by an argonaute protein (AGO) into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and the other (passenger strand) is discarded. The discrimination mechanism for strand selection involves sensing of the thermodynamic stability of the 5&#x02019;-ends of both strands and selection of those with lower 5&#x02019;-end stability as a guide. In our approach, we calculate the minimum free energy (MFE) of both ends of the duplex, and the strand with the lower stability (high MFE) at its 5&#x02019;-end is selected as a guide strand.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-10-01023-g001"/></fig><p>The terminal nucleotide rule basically proposes that the presence of U or A as 5&#x02019;-terminal nucleotide will predetermine this strand as a guide strand especially if it is combined with a G or C nucleotide at the 5&#x02019;-end of the opposite strand. The relative thermodynamic characteristics at both ends of a siRNA double chain provide additional criteria for selection of the guide strand. The guide strand is determined as the strand with significantly lower thermodynamic stability at its 5&#x02032; terminal nucleotide in comparison with the opposite strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">

In contrast to other techniques that target the genomic DNA (e.g., CRISPR/Cas-9), RNAi offers several advantages: RNAi is able to target simultaneously multiple sequence-related transcripts. This can be, e.g., transcripts that are encoded by a gene family. The knockdown nature of RNAi also allows targeting genes, which cause lethality after knockout. Therefore, further development of tools and methods for RNAi applications remains an important task. The <bold>si-Fi21</bold> software tool that we present here is specifically intended for design of long double-stranded RNAi that is widely used in non-vertebrate systems. The prediction accuracy of <bold>si-Fi21</bold> was validated by performing multiple experiments for estimation of the gene silencing effect of specifically designed RNAi triggers. The experimental outcome was validating the results to the predicted features. Since direct measurement of the decrease of the target gene transcript is technically not feasible in this model system, we have used the phenotypic effect of the silencing of the Mlo gene as a proxy for the silencing of its transcript (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Douchkov et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Mlo</italic> silencing experiments show that the RNAi efficiency is rapidly decreasing, if the overall sequence similarity drops below 92% (4MY construct in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>). Interestingly, the 3MY construct shows the strongest effect. However, the differences between the constructs 0MY to 3MY are not statistically significant. As the used system is based on the interaction of two living organisms, it is associated with considerable variance. This drawback can be overcome with a high number of feasible independent repetitions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">
<bold>Supplementary Table S2</bold>
</xref>).</p><p>Combined analysis of the siRNA sequence and target sites allows defining siRNAs with putatively high efficiency. Applying strand selection rules (U or A at the 5&#x02019;-end; MFE on the 5&#x02019;-end higher than those of the 5&#x02019;-end of the opposite strand; &#x00394;MFE of the first three nucleotides of each strand &#x0003e;1&#x02009;kcal/mol) identifies siRNAs that will be included into the RISC complex with a high probability. Calculation of the probability of local accessibility on the target (u = 8, threshold 0.1) predicts the siRNAs that are targeting accessible parts of the target RNA. These ones have a higher chance to cause a silencing effect. Combination of both selection criteria is increasing the prediction power for RNAi efficiency. However, if the criteria for selection for siRNA efficiency are set too stringent, this may cause a non-detection of some potential off-targets. Therefore, we have designed two different modes of siRNA selection. The high-sensitivity (HS) mode is using less stringent selection parameters (only strand selection rules), and it is primarily designed for finding a maximum number of potential off-targets. The high-efficiency (HE) mode is using stringent parameters (stricter strand selection rules plus target site accessibility calculations), and it will select for siRNA with strong silencing potential. The HE-mode is primarily used for RNAi construct design where maximum siRNA efficiency is desired.</p><p>The number of predicted siRNA hits in HS- and HE-modes, related to the silencing effect of the corresponding constructs, provides an estimate of <bold>si-Fi21</bold> prediction power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>). The maximum number of total, HS-, and HE-mode matching siRNAs is generated by the construct with perfect 500-bp match to the target. The 0MY construct may generate up to 480 different siRNAs with 239 and 26 of them matching the selection criteria in HS-mode and HE-mode, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">
<bold>Supplementary Table S4</bold>
</xref>). The number of matching siRNA is progressively decreasing parallel to the decreasing overall identity of the RNAi trigger to the target. The 1MY to 3MY constructs are predicted to generate reduced numbers of HE-mode siRNAs, whereas from the 4MY construct onward, the number of HE-mode siRNAs drops to zero. These predictions are in good agreement with the observed <italic>Mlo</italic> silencing effects, which were significantly weaker, compared with the 0MY reference, from 4MY onward. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref> suggest a putative threshold mechanism, where the silencing effect is exhibited only after reaching a certain siRNA pressure on the target.</p><p>Identical experiments were performed with the 100-bp window constructs. Although all constructs are expected to generate nearly the same number of matching siRNA (80 to 81), their effect on susceptibility to <italic>Bgh</italic> differed substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">
<bold>Figure 4</bold>
</xref>). Only the 401&#x02013;500W construct had a significant effect on RSI. While two out of the four inefficient constructs, 101&#x02013;200W and 201&#x02013;300W, were associated with relatively high numbers of HE-mode siRNA predictions, they were still below the number of HE-hits of the most active 401&#x02013;500W construct, which points into the direction of a threshold-dependent process of RNAi efficiency. This threshold phenomenon might be related to the short time window for observing TIGS-induced phenotypes: A suboptimal construct might not be capable of silencing the target rapidly enough to reveal the phenotypic effect, although the same construct might silence the target gradually during its continuous exposure to the siRNAs (e.g., in a transgenic plant). All 100-bp RNAi constructs gave rise to comparable numbers of HS-mode siRNAs indicating that this criterion is not sufficient to predict efficient silencing. Taken together, the results presented here suggest that the maximum number of HE-mode siRNA molecules might be a useful indicator for optimal RNAi-construct design.

The software provides two different modeling modes&#x02014;HS (high sensitivity) for off-target search and HE (high efficiency) for RNAi-construct design. Each of the two modes is based on an own pipeline with adapted parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
<bold>Figure 5</bold>
</xref>). The si-Fi21 tool is specifically intended for long double-stranded RNAi constructs including virus-, microRNA-, and host-induced gene silencing (HIGS). The software offers the possibility to create custom sequence databases, allows flexible settings of parameters, and provides easy-to-interpret graphical and tabular outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">

The off-target prediction is using the high-sensitivity (HS) mode settings for finding as many as possible putative off-targets as possible by minimizing the false-positive signals. The RNAi design is using the high-efficiency (HE) mode for detection of most effective siRNAs by avoiding the undesired off-targeting.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-10-01023-g005"/></fig><fig id="f6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>si-Fi21</bold> screenshots and example results of the RNAi design mode.
