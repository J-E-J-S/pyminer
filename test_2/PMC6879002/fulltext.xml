Whole-genome reconstruction and variant discovery, accomplished by analysis of data from whole-genome sequencing experiments, are foundational for the study of human genomic variation and analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships. Over the past decades, cost-effective whole-genome sequencing has been revolutionized by short-fragment approaches, the most widespread of which have been the consistently improving generations of the original Solexa technology [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], now referred to as Illumina sequencing. Illumina's strengths and weaknesses are inherent in the sample preparation and sequencing chemistry. Illumina generates short paired reads (2 &#x000d7; 150 bp for the highest-throughput platforms) from short fragments (usually 400&#x02013;500 bp [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Because many clonally amplified molecules generate a robust signal during the sequencing reaction, Illumina's average per-base error rates are very low.</p><p>The lack of long-range contiguity between end-sequenced short fragments limits their application for reconstructing personal genomes. Long-range contiguity is important for phasing variants and dealing with genomic complex regions. For haplotyping, variants can be phased by population-based methods [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or family-based recombination inference [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, such approaches are only feasible for common variants in single individuals or when a trio or larger pedigree is sequenced. Furthermore, highly polymorphic regions such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in which the reference sequence does not adequately capture the diversity segregating in the population are refractory to mapping-based approaches and require <italic>de novo</italic> assembly to reconstruct [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Short-read/short-fragment data are challenged by interspersed repetitive sequences from mobile elements and by segmental duplications, and only support highly fragmented genome reconstruction [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In principle, many of these challenges can be overcome by long-read/long-fragment sequencing [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Assembly of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore (ONT) data can yield impressive contiguity of contigs and scaffolds. In 1 study [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], scaffold N50 reached 31.1 Mb by hierarchically integrating PacBio long reads and BioNano for a hybrid assembly, which also uncovered novel tandem repeats and replicated the structural variants (SVs) that were newly included in the updated hg38 human reference sequence. Another study [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] produced human genome assemblies with ONT data, in which a contig N50 &#x0223c;3 Mb was achieved, and long contigs covered all class I HLA regions. A recent whole-genome assembly of NA24385 [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with high-quality PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) reads generated contigs with an N50 of 15 Mb. However, long-fragment sequencing is hindered by extremely high cost (in the case of PacBio CCS) or low base quality (in the case of single-pass reads of either technology), hampering its usefulness for personal genome assembly.</p><p>Hierarchical assembly pipelines in which multiple data types are used is another approach for genome assembly [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, in the reconstruction of an Asian personal genome, fosmid clone pools and Illumina data were merged, but because fosmid libraries are highly labor intensive to generate and sequence, this approach is not generalizable to personal genomes. The &#x0201c;long fragment read&#x0201d; (LFR) approach [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], where a long fragment is sequenced at high depth via single-molecule fragmented amplification, reported promising personal genome assembly and variant phasing by attaching a barcode to the short reads derived from the same long fragment. However, because LFR is implemented in a 384-well plate, many long fragments would be labeled by the same barcodes, making it difficult for binning short reads, and the great sequencing depth required rendered LFR not cost-effective.</p><p>An alternative approach is offered by the 10x Genomics Chromium system, which distributes the DNA preparation into millions of partitions where partition-specific barcode sequences are attached to short amplification products that are templated off the input fragments. Because of the limited reaction efficiency in each partition, the sequencing depth for each fragment is too shallow to reconstruct the original long fragment, distinguishing this approach from LFR [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, to compensate for the low read coverage of each fragment, each genomic region is covered by hundreds of DNA fragments, giving overall sequence coverage that is in a range comparable to standard Illumina short-fragment sequencing while providing very high physical coverage. Novel computational approaches leveraging the special characteristics of 10x Genomics data have already generated significant advances in power and accuracy of haplotyping [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], cancer genome reconstruction [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], metagenomic assemblies [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of human and other genomes [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref>], compared to standard Illumina short-fragment sequencing. While the uniformity of sequence coverage is not as good as with PCR-free Illumina libraries, 10x Linked-Read sequencing is a promising technology that combines low per-base error and good small-variant discovery with long-range information for much improved SV detection in mapping-based approaches [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the possibility of long-range contiguity in <italic>de novo</italic> assembly [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Practical advantages of the technology include the low DNA input mass requirement (1 ng per library, or &#x0223c;300 haploid human genome equivalents). Real input quantities can vary, along with other factors, to influence an interconnected array of parameters that are relevant to genome assembly and reconstruction. The parameters over which the experimenter has influence are (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>) as follows: (i) <italic>C<sub>R</sub></italic>: average coverage of short reads per fragment; (ii) <italic>C<sub>F</sub></italic>: average physical coverage of the genome by long DNA fragments; (iii) <italic>N<sub>F/P</sub></italic>: number of fragments per partition; (iv) fragment length distribution, several parameters of which are used, specifically <inline-formula><tex-math id="M2">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

For example, we set out to ask whether longer input fragments produce better assemblies, or what the effect of sequencing vs physical coverage is on contiguity of assembly. To constrain the parameter space, we first performed computer simulations with reasonably realistic synthetic data. The simulation results suggested certain parameter combinations that we then approximated in the generation of real, high-depth, sequence data on 2 human reference genome cell lines, NA12878 and NA24385. These simulated and real data sets were then used to produce <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies, with an emphasis on the performance of 10x's Supernova2 [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

However, the 10x Chromium system performs amplification in each partition, and generally only &#x0223c;20&#x02013;40% of the original long fragment sequence can be captured as short fragments and eventually as reads, resulting in shallow sequencing coverage per fragment. Sequencing more deeply does not increase the per-fragment coverage much because most of the extra reads are from PCR duplicates. The solution is to sequence multiple 10x libraries constructed from the same DNA preparation and merge them for analysis. This means that <italic>C<sub>R</sub></italic> remains in the standard range where PCR duplicates are relatively rare, but <italic>C<sub>F</sub></italic> increases proportionally to the number of libraries used. A practical limitation to this approach is that Supernova2 limits the number of barcodes to 4.8 million.</p><p>Our results showed that in practice, <italic>C<sub>F</sub></italic> should be between 335&#x000d7; and 823&#x000d7;, but no larger than 1,000&#x000d7;, given the optimal coverage of <italic>C</italic> = 56&#x000d7; recommended by 10x and the requirement for sufficient per-fragment read coverage. Surprisingly, we observed that including more extremely long fragments was detrimental for assembly quality. This is possibly due to the loss of barcode specificity for fragments spanning repetitive sequences. From a computational perspective, too many long fragments are harmful to deconvolving the de Bruijn graph because more complex paths need to be picked out.

We show that maximization of N50 does not necessarily reflect assembly quality, which we were able to compare to NA50 because there exists a high-quality human reference genome.

However, both contig and scaffold accuracy decreased with increasing <italic>C</italic>. We also found, counterintuitively, that contig and scaffold length mostly decreased with increasing fragment length, a phenomenon that may be due to the specific implementation; however, until there is another assembler that can be compared to Supernova2 it will not be possible to reason about this effect. In addition, intrinsic properties of the genome matter greatly because removal of repeats or lack of variation dramatically improves assembly quality.</p><p>Diploid assembly is the appropriate approach for assembly of genomes of diploid organisms that harbor variation.

We estimate that the cost increase over standard Illumina sequencing is &#x0223c;2&#x000d7;, given the 10x preparation cost and the higher level of sequence coverage required.
