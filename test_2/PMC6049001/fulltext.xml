</related-article><abstract><p>Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&#x02013;CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) genome editing is revolutionizing fundamental research and has great potential for the treatment of many diseases. While editing of immortalized cell lines has become relatively easy, editing of therapeutically relevant primary cells and tissues can remain challenging. One recent advancement is the delivery of a Cas9 protein and an in vitro&#x02013;transcribed (IVT) guide RNA (gRNA) as a precomplexed ribonucleoprotein (RNP). This approach allows editing of primary cells such as T cells and hematopoietic stem cells, but the consequences beyond genome editing of introducing foreign Cas9 RNPs into mammalian cells are not fully understood. Here, we show that the IVT gRNAs commonly used by many laboratories for RNP editing trigger a potent innate immune response that is similar to canonical immune-stimulating ligands. IVT gRNAs are recognized in the cytosol through the retinoic acid&#x02013;inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway but not the melanoma differentiation&#x02013;associated gene 5 (MDA5) pathway, thereby triggering a type I interferon response. Removal of the 5&#x02019;-triphosphate from gRNAs ameliorates inflammatory signaling and prevents the loss of viability associated with genome editing in hematopoietic stem cells. The potential for Cas9 RNP editing to induce a potent antiviral response indicates that care must be taken when designing therapeutic strategies to edit primary cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&#x02013;CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) genome editing is transforming fundamental research, as it allows researchers to make targeted changes to the genome of cells. For efficient editing, the Cas9 protein (a DNA nuclease) and a guide RNA (gRNA), which leads the nuclease to the correct location in the genome, have to be introduced into cells. One recent advancement is the delivery of a Cas9 protein and an in vitro&#x02013;transcribed (IVT) gRNA as a precomplexed ribonucleoprotein (RNP). This approach allows editing of more sensitive cell types such as immune cells and hematopoietic stem cells. However, the consequences of introducing foreign Cas9 nuclease and gRNA into mammalian cells are not fully understood. Here, we show that in many cell types, the IVT gRNAs trigger a potent innate immune response&#x02014;a natural defense mechanism against RNA viruses. We show that the innate immune response causes cell death in primary hematopoietic stem cells but that removal of the 5&#x02019;-triphosphate from gRNAs by phosphatase treatment can ameliorate the immune response and prevent the loss of viability. Hence, CRISPR-Cas9 RNP editing has the potential to induce a potent antiviral response, and we suggest that care must be taken when designing therapeutic strategies to edit primary cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Li Ka Shing Foundation.

Its ease of use and high flexibility allows researchers to modify and edit genomes in cell lines [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], stem cells [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], animals and plants [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and even human embryos [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The Cas protein complexes with a target-specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a <italic>trans</italic>-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), which keeps the Cas protein catalytically active [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In experimental procedures, the two RNAs are often combined to generate a single guide RNA (gRNA), which means that at least two components must be successfully delivered into cells during genome editing: the Cas protein, such as Cas9, and gRNA to direct the Cas9 protein to its target site. For in vitro&#x02013;cultured cells, this can be done by transfecting plasmids encoding gRNA and Cas9 protein. However, transfection of plasmid DNA into sensitive cell types such as primary and stem cells is challenging and inefficient. The introduction of plasmids can also lead to undesired integration of DNA at the cut site [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], increased off-target activity through prolonged expression of the CRISPR-Cas9 components [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and a delay in editing while the cell expresses gRNA and Cas protein [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The delivery of gRNA and Cas9 protein as a precomplexed ribonucleoprotein (RNP) sidesteps issues related to plasmid expression and has proved to be a successful strategy to edit human primary cells, including T cells [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], hematopoietic stem cells [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and neurons [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This makes RNP editing a particularly attractive approach for therapeutic applications, but relatively little is known about the nonediting consequences of introducing a foreign gRNA and Cas9 protein. Human cells have evolved multiple defense mechanisms to guard against foreign components, and genome editing reagents have the potential to activate these systems. For example, recent data suggest that humans may have a preexisting adaptive immune response to the Cas9 protein [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. But cellular responses to the gRNAs used to program Cas9 editing have so far not been well explored.</p><p>Cells respond to infection by RNA viruses with an innate immune response that protects the host cell from invading foreign genetic material [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Foreign RNAs are recognized by pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) binding receptors in the cytosol that include retinoic acid&#x02013;inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation&#x02013;associated gene 5 (MDA5) [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This triggers a cascade of events mediated by the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, resulting in the transcriptional activation of type I interferons and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. RNA PAMPs usually contain exposed 5&#x02019;-triphosphate ends [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which may also be present in gRNAs made via T7 in vitro transcription [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Given that Cas9 has a picomolar affinity for targeting gRNA [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], it is not clear that the 5&#x02019;-triphosphate would be available to stimulate an innate immune response.</p><p>We asked whether in vitro-transcribed (IVT) gRNAs complexed with Cas9 cause an innate immune response and here show that introduction of RNPs into cells induces up-regulation of interferon beta (IFN&#x003b2;) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) in a variety of human cell types. This activity depends upon RIG-I and MAVS but is independent of MDA5. The extent of the immune response depends upon the protospacer sequence, but removal of the 5&#x02019;-triphosphate from gRNAs avoids stimulation of innate immune signaling. The potential for Cas9 RNP editing to induce an antiviral response indicates that care must be taken when designing therapeutic strategies to edit primary cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate if mammalian cells react to IVT gRNA/Cas9 with an innate immune response, we first performed genome editing in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells using Cas9 RNPs. To separate innate immune response from genome editing, we performed these experiments with a nontargeting gRNA that recognizes a sequence within blue fluorescent protein (BFP) and has no known targets within the human genome [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Constant amounts of recombinant Cas9 protein were complexed with different amounts of nontargeting IVT gRNA, and RNPs were transfected into HEK293 cells using CRISPRMAX lipofection reagent [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We harvested cells 30 h after transfection and measured transcript levels of <italic>interferon beta 1</italic> (<italic>IFNB1)</italic> and <italic>ISG15</italic> by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005840.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). Introduction of gRNAs caused a dramatic increase in both <italic>IFNB1</italic> and <italic>ISG15</italic> levels, and the presence of Cas9 protein did not have an effect on the outcome. Cas9 on its own did not induce <italic>IFNB1</italic> or <italic>ISG15</italic> expression. To our surprise, as little as 1 nM of gRNA was sufficient to trigger a 30&#x02013;50-fold increase in the transcription of innate immune genes. We further found that a commonly administered amount of 50 nM gRNA can induce <italic>IFNB1</italic> by 1,000-fold, which is equal to induction by canonical IFN&#x003b2; inducers such as viral mRNA from Sendai virus [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or a hepatitis C virus (HCV) PAMP [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005840.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="pbio.2005840.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.2005840.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Transfection of IVT gRNAs into HEK293 cells triggers a type I interferon response.</title><p>(A) qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>IFNB1</italic> and <italic>ISG15</italic> transcript levels in HEK293 cells transfected with increasing amounts of gRNA with and without Cas9 protein.

We wondered if the transfection method would affect the IFN&#x003b2; response and compared gRNA transfection via lipofection (Lipofectamine 2000 and RNAiMAX) to nucleofection (Lonza) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005840.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). Lipofection led to a strong increase in <italic>IFNB1</italic> and <italic>ISG15</italic> transcript levels after as little as 6 h posttransfection, and the response was sustained for up to 48 h. Nucleofection also caused an increase in innate immune signaling at early time points, but the response was milder than in lipofected samples and was greatly diminished by 48 h.</p><p>Next, we asked if the innate immune response to gRNAs is a common phenomenon across different cell types and compared IFN&#x003b2; activation in seven commonly used human cell lines of various lineages: human embryonic kidney cells 293 SV40 large T antigen (HEK293T), HEK293, Henrietta Lacks cells (HeLa), Jurkat, HCT116, HepG2, and K562 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005840.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>).

We designed 10 additional nontargeting gRNAs that we in vitro transcribed and transfected into HEK293 cells. Surprisingly, we found that the cells responded to different protospacers with a wide range of <italic>IFNB1</italic> expression. Several gRNAs produced very little innate immune response, and one gRNA (gRNA11) yielded no <italic>IFNB1</italic> activation at all (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005840.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>).

We asked if preparations that remove the 5&#x02019; triphosphate might avoid or reduce the innate immune response to IVT gRNAs. We first used a synthetic gRNA that lacks a 5&#x02019;-triphosphate and verified that this gRNA does not induce <italic>IFNB1</italic> expression when transfected into HEK293 cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005840.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). Synthetic gRNAs are becoming more commonplace but are still an order of magnitude more expensive than in vitro transcription of gRNAs. This limits their application for high-throughput interrogation of gene function in primary cells. We therefore asked if treatment of IVT gRNA with phosphatases that remove the 5&#x02019;-triphosphate would reduce <italic>IFNB1</italic> induction.

Hence, we asked if there is a correlation between the IFN&#x003b2; response and cell viability after transfection with synthetic, IVT, or CIP-treated IVT gRNA. Not surprisingly, the viability of the very robust HEK293 cell line was not affected by the antiviral immune response (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005840.s003">S3D Fig</xref></bold>).

We were also interested in editing outcomes in these samples and performed amplicon next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the <italic>HBB</italic> locus. While the phosphatase-treated gRNA performed similarly to the synthetic gRNA, the IVT gRNA resulted in slightly fewer insertions and deletions (indels) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005840.g003">Fig 3G</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec003"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have found that IVT gRNAs used with Cas9 RNPs for many genome-editing experiments can trigger a strong innate immune response in many mammalian cell types (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005840.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>). Lipofection results in a stronger and longer-lasting response than nucleofection, possibly because lipofection delivers gRNAs to the cytosol, while nucleofection delivers mainly to the nucleus. Using isogenic KO clones, we found the gRNA-induced response is mediated via the antiviral RIG-I pathway and results in expression of genes that initiate an antiviral immune response. While introduction of IFN-stimulating gRNAs does not affect viability in HEK293 cells, we found that viability of primary HSPCs is negatively affected by the antiviral immune response. While DSBs have on their own been reported to induce an innate immune response [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we found triphosphate-containing gRNAs complexed with dCas9 induce an immune response and cell death in HSPCs.

This results in phosphorylation of IRF3/7 and their shuttling into the nucleus to activate expression of type I interferons (IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;). This triggers the expression of ISGs. This innate immune response changes the transcriptome of the cell and can cause cell stress and/or death, which in turn might affect the editing outcomes.

We suggest that the gene signature associated with type I interferon stimulation should be considered when studying the transcriptome of recently edited bulk populations of cells. Furthermore, all mammalian cells can both produce type I interferons and also respond to them through the ubiquitously expressed receptor interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Even cells that have not been successfully transfected with RNPs could sense the IFN&#x003b2; produced by neighboring cells and activate downstream antiviral defense mechanisms. This could be an important consideration during <italic>in vivo</italic> genome editing applications, as RNP delivery into one set of cells could provoke a widespread innate immune response in the surrounding tissues.</p><p>We found that synthetic gRNAs completely circumvent the RIG-I mediated response, offering a valuable path to avoid innate immune signaling during therapeutic editing. However, synthetic gRNAs can become expensive when performing experiments that require testing or using many gRNAs. We found that a cost-effective phosphatase treatment to remove the 5&#x02019;-triphosphate before transfection reduces the immune response and increases posttransfection viability in HSPCs. Furthermore, editing outcomes in cell lines with phosphatase-treated gRNA were comparable to those of IVT gRNAs, suggesting that removal of 5&#x02019;-phosphate groups does not abolish gRNA function. In fact, in sensitive HSPCs, phosphatase-treated gRNA slightly outperformed IVT gRNA, which is possibly due to reduced viability in samples transfected with IVT-RNPs. Thus, consideration of a potential innate immune stimulation prior to choice of genome editing reagents, study design, and implementation of controls is critical when performing genome editing using RNPs in mammalian cells.</p><p>While we were preparing this manuscript for submission, the Kim group reported similar results in HeLa cells and primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. They confirmed that the type I interferon response is dependent on the presence of a 5&#x02019;-triphopsphate group and that CIP treatment can increase viability by avoiding the antiviral response. These results are very much in alignment with our findings and extend the potential problem of innate immune signaling to additional cell types.</p><p>Our study adds extra depth by further outlining the mechanisms by which gRNAs are sensed. We show that gRNA sensing depends upon RIG-I and MAVS, but MDA5 KO cells are fully capable of inducing IFN&#x003b2; after IVT gRNA transfection. Hence, gRNA sensing is independent of the MDA5 PAMP receptor, consistent with RIG-I&#x02019;s preference for short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures and MDA5&#x02019;s preference for long dsRNA fragments [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Furthermore, we show that in addition to a 5&#x02019;-triphosphate, the protospacer sequence is also critical to determine the intensity of the IFN&#x003b2; response. Not only do different gRNAs induce different innate immune responses, but some gRNAs induce no response at all. However, this seems to be cell-type specific, as we found that sensitive cells such as primary HSPCs react to the same gRNAs with a strong immune response independently of the protospacer. It has been proposed that 5&#x02019;-base-paired RNA structures are required to activate antiviral signaling via RIG-I, but we found no correlation between signaling and a variety of predicted RNA properties, including secondary structure [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our results therefore suggest that the mechanism of gRNA sensing by the RIG-I pathway is relatively complex in that it requires 5&#x02019;-triphosphates but that this moiety is not sufficient to induce the response. Additionally, we have not ruled out the possibility that gRNAs could be recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), though we and others [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] have found that KO of RIG-I is sufficient to completely abrogate gRNA-induced signaling in multiple cell contexts. The role of TLR recognition could be addressed in future work to delineate the full set of molecular features responsible for gRNA activation of innate immunity, which might yield accurate predictors of innate immune signaling in general.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec004"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec005"><title>In vitro transcription of gRNAs</title><p>gRNA was synthesized by assembly PCR and in vitro transcription as previously described [<xref rid="pbio.2005840.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
