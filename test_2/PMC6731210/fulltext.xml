Mutations in ADSL can result in inborn errors of metabolism characterized by developmental delay and disorder phenotypes, with no effective treatment options. Recently, SAICAR, a metabolic substrate of ADSL, has been found to have alternative roles in the cell, complicating the role of ADSL. crADSL, a CRISPR KO of ADSL in HeLa cells, was constructed to investigate DNPS and ADSL in a human cell line. Here we employ this cell line in an RNA-seq analysis to initially investigate the effect of DNPS and ADSL deficiency on the transcriptome as a first step in establishing a cellular model of ADSL deficiency. We report transcriptome changes in genes relevant to development, vascular development, muscle, and cancer biology, which provide interesting avenues for future research.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>Purine synthesis</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Adenylosuccinate lyase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="ks0010"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>adenosine monophosphate, (AMP)</kwd><kwd>adenylosuccinate lyase, (ADSL)</kwd><kwd>aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide, (AICAR)</kwd><kwd>de novo purine synthesis, (DNPS)</kwd><kwd>differentially expressed gene, (DEG)</kwd><kwd>false discovery rate, (FDR)</kwd><kwd>fetal calf macroserum, (FCM)</kwd><kwd>fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped, (FPKM)</kwd><kwd>gene ontology, (GO)</kwd><kwd>guanosine monophosphate, (GMP)</kwd><kwd>minus adenine crADSL to minus adenine WT comparison, (MM)</kwd><kwd>phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, (PRPP)</kwd><kwd>phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide, (SAICAR)</kwd><kwd>plus adenine crADSL to plus adenine WT comparison, (PP)</kwd><kwd>succinyladenosine monophosphate, (SAMP)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Defects in de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) can cause inborn errors of metabolism. Of particular interest, adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiency, an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism, has been observed in approximately 80 individuals to date [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is typically diagnosed by SAICA-riboside accumulation in biofluids [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With advances in genomic sequencing and reduction in cost, it is likely that the number of diagnosed ADSL deficient patients will increase in the future. The phenotype of ADSL deficiency is variable and affects multiple systems, presenting as fatal neonatal, severe, or mild to moderate forms including features such as seizures, autistic traits, psychomotor retardation, respiratory failure, and microcephaly. This implies that there are significant alterations in gene expression in ADSL deficiency. The ADSL enzyme is a homotetramer and mutations in ADSL can result in altered tetramer stability or active site disruption resulting in reduced levels of enzyme activity [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the most severe cases, enzyme activity may be reduced by as much as 75%.</p><p id="p0010">DNPS is one of the most ancient biochemical pathways [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In mammalian DNPS, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is converted to inosine monophosphate (IMP) in ten enzymatic steps by six different enzymes. IMP is converted to either adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or guanosine monophosphate (GMP) via two additional enzymatic steps (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). ADSL is a bifunctional homotetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the eighth step, forming aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) from phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide (SAICAR). It is also responsible for the final step in the conversion of IMP to AMP, specifically cleaving succinyladenosine monophosphate (SAMP) into AMP (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). ADSL is thought to be an enzyme with straightforward and defined functions, however recent evidence suggests a more complicated cellular role.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>de novo purine synthetic pathway (DNPS). PRPP is the input small molecule and is converted by six enzymes in ten steps to IMP and is further processed to either AMP or GMP via two additional steps. ADSL is responsible for SAICAR to AICAR and SAMP to AMP. crADSL is the CRISPR generated HeLa cell line used in this study that lacks ADSL enzyme.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0015">The DNPS intermediates and products have multiple functions within the cell including energy production/regulation via ATP, GTP, and cAMP, cellular signaling, growth, and regulation of other pathways. Recently, the intermediate SAICAR was found to allosterically bind pyruvate kinase M isoform 2 (PKM2) [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the dominant isoform present in tumors. PKM2 catalyzes the last and only irreversible step of glycolysis, forming pyruvate from phosphoenol pyruvate. The dominance of this isoform in tumors is thought to be the root of the Warburg Effect: the production of lactic acid and consequent metabolic reprogramming via aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PKM2 was also found to act as a co-regulator of transcription [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] by binding transcription factors. SAICAR binding to PKM2 is thought to activate a &#x0201c;moonlighting&#x0201d; PKM2 protein kinase activity that acts to directly alter transcription [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, this hypothesis is controversial [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. SAICAR was also shown to bind both the dimeric and tetrameric forms of PKM2 [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] although recent work suggests that the binding of SAICAR to the dimer promotes its pyruvate kinase activity [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. PKM2 was found to induce the hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1&#x003b1;) protein upon nuclear translocation of PKM2 [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which initiates angiogenic and tumorigenic-related events in the cell. SAICAR also accumulates in glucose starved conditions [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] although the mechanism for this is not well understood.</p><p id="p0020">Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 was used to generate knock-outs of the enzymes involved in DNPS including ADSL (designated crADSL) [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The crADSL cells have approximately 1.7% ADSL activity compared to wild type cells [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], accumulate SAICAR [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and fail to grow in the absence of adenine [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To investigate the utility of crADSL as a model for ADSL deficiency, RNA-seq was employed to determine transcriptome differences between crADSL and wild type HeLa (WT) cells cultured for 10&#x0202f;h in the presence/absence of adenine. RNA-seq is a tool that can provide a snapshot of global transcriptional activity and can aid in characterizing cellular response to mutations, nutrients, stressors, etc. Changes in gene transcription can be rapidly identified and parsed into various groupings, such as gene ontologies or characterized pathways and reactions. As an initial step in understanding alterations in gene expression in ADSL deficiency, we used RNA-seq to compare gene expression in wt HeLa and crADSL cells in the presence and absence of SAICAR accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell culture</title><p id="p0025">crADSL was constructed as described previously [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HeLa cells (CCL-2) were purchased from ATCC (Manassass, Virginia, USA). Cells were grown on 60&#x0202f;mm TPP plates (Techno Plastic Products, AG, Switzerland) with regularly refreshed Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 30&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M adenine, and normocin (Invivogen). For purine deprivation experiments (hereafter referred to as starvation), complete medium with 30&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M adenine was exchanged two days and one day before starvation. Adenine is used as a nutritional supplement for DNPS experiments as it can be converted to AMP and GMP via enzymes not affected by DNPS knockouts [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Ten to twelve hours prior to starvation, medium was exchanged to DMEM 10% FCS with 100&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M adenine, a concentration of adenine that completely inhibits DNPS [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To induce starvation or control conditions, once plates reached ~50&#x02013;70% confluence, medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% FCM (fetal calf macroserum is FCS dialyzed against saline using a 3.5&#x0202f;kDa barrier), normocin, with or without 100&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M adenine. For cell colony staining experiments, cells were plated in complete growth medium and then medium was exchanged for DMEM 10% FCM, normocin, with or without 30&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M adenine.

Each category has a specific aim: biological process includes genes that contribute to completion of a biological objective, cellular component refers to gene product localization, and molecular function refers to the biochemical activity of gene products [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The Reactome knowledgebase systematically maps gene products into pathway and reaction networks (or metabolic maps, [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). In our discussion of ontology and Reactome enrichment in the gene sets, term will be used for a singular ontology or Reactome annotation that shows enrichment due to genes associated with that specific component, pathway, process, reaction, or function. It is important to note that terms may be enriched in a single comparison; that however does not indicate that the term was not significant in the other comparison.</p><p id="p0080">In GO Biological Process, DEGs mapped to 95 shared terms in 27 groups (See <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, for details see Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3) The most notable among these are epithelial to mesenchymal transition with 29.65% of terms related to this group, amyloid fibril formation with 12.06% of terms associated, and actin nucleation at 7.04%. Other notable shared terms involve processes such as smooth muscle cell and heart structure development, neuron or brain associated function/development, bone mineralization, hormone processing, as well as interleukins, Wnt signaling, and tumor necrosis factor. In the PP comparisons, we see many overlaps within the shared groupings, however it should be noted that exit from mitosis, and transcription regulatory region DNA binding were heavily enriched terms. For the MM comparisons, we see mass overlap of terms associated with larger parent groups in the shared list, however Glycosaminoglycan catabolic process as well as some actin/myosin-based terms were heavily enriched while terms associated with TGF&#x003b2; were mildly enriched.<fig id="f0025"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Notable processes identified via ClueGO analysis.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0025">Fig. 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig></p><p id="p0085">The Cellular Component ontology produced 6 shared terms in 4 groups (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Figs. 4, 5).

Mild enrichment in the PP showed 3 terms in 3 groups in Histone acetyltransferase activity, HMG box domain binding, and R-SMAD binding activity while MM has term enrichment in A&#x003b2; and TGF&#x003b2; binding and lipoprotein particle receptor binding.</p><p id="p0095">The Reactome Pathway results showed 10 shared terms in 4 groups (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Figs. 8, 9) involved with kinase activity as well as antiviral mechanism by IFN-stimulated genes at 7.41% gene term association term and complement cascades. Collagen type terms were also strongly enriched in shared pairings due to COL15A1, COL25A1, COL3A1, and COL4A4 being present in both lists analyzed. There were no strong preferential associations in the PP list with 5 terms in 4 groups, however slight enrichment in the PP terms were seen in scavenger receptor ligands, EPH-ephrin repulsion, and signaling by PDGF. Immune system terms OAS antiviral response and IFNG response (with 33.33% and 5.43% gene term association respectively) were seen in the PP comparison. The MM comparison showed more interesting enrichment with 19 terms in 6 groups. Due to the TMOD1 and TNNT1 gene differential expression, striated muscle contraction was heavily enriched. HS-GAG metabolism and other terms associated with GAG were heavily enriched in the MM comparison due to differential expression of GPC5 and HSPG2. For genes slightly enriched in the MM comparison over the PP comparison, collagen related terms such as integrin, ECM proteoglycans, and NCAM, CRMPs and semaphorin, as well as post-translational modification were also slightly enriched in the MM comparison. Various interferon and antiviral terms were slightly enriched in the MM comparison.</p><p id="p0100">The Reactome Reactions results showed similar patterns as Pathways, with strong enrichment in the MM comparison over the PP comparison.

The singular enriched PP term associated with IFNG was only slightly enriched. MM comparison revealed 17 terms in 6 groups. Heavily enriched terms in the MM comparison were associated with muscle contraction due to the TMOD1 and TNNT1 gene. GAG based tetrasaccharide linker terms were heavily enriched due to the presence of GPC5 and HSPG2.

Further, we performed qPCR to verify our RNA-seq results. Our results demonstrate that crADSL requires purine (adenine) supplementation for proliferative growth, SAICAR accumulates over a time course of ten hours during purine starvation, and we obtain many DEGs both by cell type and adenine supplementation.</p><p id="p0120">Previous results [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] support the hypothesis that SAICAR accumulation should produce robust transcriptome changes via the &#x0201c;moonlighting&#x0201d; PKM2 protein kinase activity. It is important to note that their methods are limited to gene chip experiments and not evaluation of viable cells in culture. We observed changes in both PP and MM (SAICAR accumulating) conditions, which suggests that SAICAR accumulation and general ADSL deficiency both mediate transcriptome alteration. Our results show a greater number of DEGs in the MM versus PP comparison, which suggests that SAICAR may be regulating transcription activity, either by a PKM2-SAICAR co-regulation activity or some other mechanism. If PKM2 does act as a co-regulator of transcription, the PKM2-SAICAR complex may potentially activate a select subset of targets for this activity. Our current experiments suggest a SAICAR derived effect on transcription.</p><p id="p0125">In GO Biological Process, we obtained a robust group of terms including and related to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;). EMT refers to the process by which polar epithelial cells undergo biochemical changes that convert them to mesenchymal cells, which exhibit increased resistance to apoptosis and enhanced migratory and invasiveness properties [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. EMT is important in embryogenesis, specifically during primitive streak formation as well as during neural crest formation. EMT in embryogenesis is orchestrated by the Wnt signaling pathway [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consistent with the EMT related terms, we also observed Wnt signaling pathway in our shared comparison. Disruption in EMT might play an important role in the developmental and neurological phenotypes associated with ADSL deficiency (discussed below). EMT is also important in inflammation and cell migration. Upon trauma to basement membranes, epithelial cells can undergo EMT in response to inflammation from injury [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our results show changes in genes in inflammation/interferon pathways, such as interferon signaling, and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. Terms associated with interferon, inflammation, and immunity were present in the MM comparison, which suggests that these transcriptional changes are the result of SAICAR accumulation and supports the tentative hypothesis that ADSL deficiency may be an immunological disorder. It also suggests that ADSL deficiency and/or DNPS deficiency may play an important role in immune dysfunction in cancer.</p><p id="p0130">In our GO and Reactome analyses, many shared terms mapped to development associated groups. Since ADSL deficiency is a developmental disorder with phenotypes including dysmorphic features, cognitive deficits, seizures, and psychomotor retardation, it is possible that these terms may be relevant to a plausible explanation of phenotype. In addition, we observed an interesting enrichment in many muscle and movement type terms and groups. This is consistent with the high level of expression of ADSL in muscle cells [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and may be informative to the psychomotor retardation phenotype observed in ADSL deficiency. Our GO and Reactome results indicate that disruption to DNPS (and ADSL specifically) alters energy production and energy levels and sensing needs, which affect force generation in muscle cells.</p><p id="p0135">Cancer is characterized, among other features, by constitutive cellular division, alterations in cellular metabolism (Warburg Effect) [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], collagen network restructuring [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], metastasis and infiltration, and changes in immune function [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results show enrichment for these and related terms, which suggests important roles for DNPS deficiency and/or SAICAR accumulation in these cancer-related processes. In addition to the collagen, integrin, EMT, actin, and ECM terms, our GO cellular component analysis showed enrichment for lamellipodia and filopodia. Filopodia employ integrins to produce finger-like protrusions preparatory to cellular migration. Filopodia formation is an important mechanism for cell migration and infiltration during tumor cell metastasis [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Recently, the role of ADSL in certain cancer types was probed suggesting a potential link in aggressive phenotypes [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p id="p0140">While the scope of this manuscript is focused on the ontologies associated with DNPS and ADSL knockout, several individual genes were identified as of specific interest. Aberrations in ALPP, a placental alkaline phosphatase, have been implicated in spontaneous abortions [<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and in some forms of cancers [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Twist1 is a transcription factor important for craniofacial and organ development during embryogenesis, most likely from mesoderm derived tissues, and has been identified in multiple types of tumors and involved in cancer metastasis, resistance to chemotherapy, and it can over-ride oncogene induced apoptosis [<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. TUSC3 (tumor suppressor candidate 3) is associated with multiple functions including Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake, glycosylation and embryonic development, in addition to its tumor suppression function [<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. IQGAP2 integrates Rho GTPase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin signals for cellular adhesion and cytoskeleton reorganization and was recently found to act as a tumor suppressor [<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. DPYSL3 (CRMP4) is primarily a neuronal protein expressed during development and adult stages and is responsible for various tasks including cell migration, differentiation, neurite extension, and axonal regeneration [<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It also has been found to play a role in some non-neuronal cancers in migration and metastasis, although the exact role is still being investigated [<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. GATA3 is a transcription factor and regulator of numerous developmental pathways and has been found heavily associated with breast cancer [<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. OASL is a gene associated with viral response and immunity, with activation carried out by interferons [<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. TGF&#x003b2;I is a ubiquitously secreted ECM protein with plausible participation in morphogenic, embryonic developmental, adhesive/migratory, tumorigenic, wound healing, and inflammatory processes [<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is apparent with ontologies and gene variability that DNPS and ADSL provide an important context for the study of developmental and cancer biology.</p><p id="p0145">Individuals with ADSL deficiency have a mutated form of ADSL with reduced enzymatic activity. This implies reduced (but not halted) conversion of SAICAR to AICAR and is consistent with results from patient studies [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to a reduced rate of conversion of SAICAR to AICAR, we would expect transcriptome alteration due to persistent elevation in SAICAR and a reduction in the rate of DNPS. Here we present results detailing transcriptome changes in crADSL due to elimination of ADSL enzyme activity. Future studies will investigate differences between mutant forms of ADSL, and may employ specific cell lines to assess the effects of ADSL dysregulation in developmental, tumor, vascular and muscle biology. These cells and cells transfected with mutant forms of ADSL should provide an invaluable cellular model of ADSL deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0150">This work was funded by <funding-source id="gts0005">The ADSL Research Fund</funding-source> of the <funding-source id="gts0010">Eleanor Roosevelt Institute</funding-source>, The Sam and Frieda Davis Trust<funding-source id="gts0015">Sam and Frieda Davis Trust</funding-source>, and The <funding-source id="gts0020">Butler Family Fund of the Denver Foundation.</funding-source></p></sec><sec id="s0095"><title>Declaration of Competimg Interest</title><p id="p0155">The authors have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jurecka</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zik&#x000e1;nov&#x000e1;</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kmoch</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tylki-Szyma&#x00144;ska</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency</article-title><source>J.
