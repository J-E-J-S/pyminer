The burden of neuropsychiatric and developmental impairment is high, with severity and prevalence correlated with gestational age at delivery. PTB is a major risk factor for the development of cerebral palsy, lower educational attainment and deficits in cognitive functioning, and individuals born preterm have higher rates of schizophrenia, autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Factors such as gestational age at birth, systemic inflammation, respiratory morbidity, sub-optimal nutrition, and genetic vulnerability are associated with poor outcome after preterm birth, but the mechanisms linking these factors to adverse long term outcome are poorly understood. One potential mechanism linking PTB with neurodevelopmental effects is changes in the epigenome. Epigenetic processes can be defined as those leading to altered gene expression in the absence of a change in the underlying DNA sequence and include DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation and histone modifications. Such epigenetic modifications may be susceptible to environmental stimuli, and changes may persist long after the stimulus has ceased, providing a mechanism to explain the long-term consequences of acute exposures in early life. Many factors such as inflammation, fluctuating oxygenation and excitotoxicity which are known factors in PTB related brain injury, have also been implicated in epigenetic dysfunction. In this review, we will discuss the potential role of epigenetic dysregulation in mediating the effects of PTB on neurodevelopmental outcome, with specific emphasis on DNA methylation and the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase family of enzymes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Preterm birth</kwd><kwd>Neurodevelopmental disorders</kwd><kwd>Epigenetic</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>Epigenetic dysregulation</kwd><kwd>&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Preterm Birth (PTB) is clinically defined as birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2010, PTB accounted for 11.1% of all live births reported worldwide, with complications directly resulting from PTB accounting for approximately 1 million deaths per year [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Seventy five percent of all deaths in the perinatal period occur among those born preterm [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and in 2013 infant mortality in England and Wales was 1.4 and 21.1 per 1000 live births for term and preterm births respectively [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and a similar relationship is thought to exist in the U.S [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In recent decades, the mortality associated with PTB has decreased with improved neonatal care, and although this was initially accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders within the surviving PTB population [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], neurodevelopmental outcomes for those born preterm have improved since the 1990&#x02019;s, possibly as a consequence of the decreased use of post-natal glucocorticoids [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, PTB remains the single largest risk factor for poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in childhood [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and is associated with an increased prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders including Cerebral Palsy [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Schizophrenia [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PTB is also predictive of cognitive score at school age, with younger gestational ages typically receiving lower scores [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this review, we outline the neurodevelopmental consequences of PTB and the mechanisms that have been identified which might account for them. We focus on the potential role of epigenetic dysregulation in mediating short and long term consequences of PTB on the developing brain, concentrating on DNA methylation and the role of the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase family.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>NEURODEVELOPMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF PTB</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Cerebral Palsy (CP)</title><p>CP describes &#x0201c;a group of disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain. The motor disorders of cerebral palsy are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, cognition, communication, perception, and/or behaviour, and/or by a seizure disorder&#x0201d; [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The disturbances to brain structure and function that underlie CP are highly varied, but PVL (Periventricular Leukomalacia) and diffuse white matter injury are frequent features [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. PVL consists of focal necrotic regions deep in the white matter consisting of both glia and neurons [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is estimated that 2-3.5/1000 neonates will go on to develop CP [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and PTB is a major risk factor. In the EPICure study of those born extremely preterm (less than 26 weeks) in the UK and Ireland, the incidence of CP was inversely proportional to gestational age [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The mechanism underlying CP and white matter injury are varied and this is reflected in the range of associated comorbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], intrauterine growth restriction [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], necrotising enterocolitis [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and chorioamnionitis [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>ADHD and Attention Difficulties</title><p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a worldwide incidence of 5.3% and is the most common childhood psychiatric disease [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. ADHD is thought to arise as a consequence of altered connectivity and neuronal network specific dysfunction [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and risk factors include prenatal exposure to recreational drugs [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], as well as being born small for gestational age, low birth weight, small head circumference and PTB [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In a large Swedish cohort, individuals born preterm had an increased incidence of ADHD, with the prevalence increasing among those born earlier [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and these results have subsequently been replicated in smaller cohorts from Italy [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Taiwan [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The symptoms of ADHD associated with PTB are more heavily weighted towards attention abnormalities than in ADHD not associated with PTB [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)</title><p>ASD diagnoses have increased in the last 50 years [<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], likely as a consequence of broadening diagnostic criteria and increased symptomatic recognition. Although ASDs can be broadly defined as consistent difficulties in both verbal and non-verbal social interactions [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], they are highly heterogeneous in their etiology, phenotype and severity and this is reflected in the DSM V criteria for ASD diagnosis, with three levels of severity and several syndromic and non-syndromic forms described [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. There is a higher prevalence of ASD in males [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], with a prevalence amongst 8-year old boys and girls in the UK of 3.8 and 0.8 per 1000 respectively [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Although genetic risk factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many syndromic and non-syndromic forms of ASD [<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which occur for example in association with Rett syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and with mutations in the Jumonji Domain Containing Histone Demethylase (JMJD1C) (a member of the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase family) [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], epidemiological studies have shown that environmental factors such as PTB and its associated insults are also significant risk factors for the development of ASD [<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, perinatal infection has been linked to ASD, for example in the large CHARGE (Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment) study, maternal influenza was specifically associated with an increased ASD incidence in offspring [<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. An increase in inflammatory markers <italic>in utero</italic> are also associated with an increased risk of ASD [<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and a non-age matched study of post-mortem tissue showed increased microglial activation within the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex of males diagnosed with ASD [<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The male bias in ASD may indicate an underlying mechanistic causation for androgens in ASD pathogenesis, indeed testosterone exposure during critical periods <italic>in utero</italic> has been shown to be crucial to brain development and has been linked with ASD development [<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Schizophrenia</title><p>Schizophrenia has a prevalence in the general population of around 5 per 1000 [<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and is thought to have developmental origins. There is an increased prevalence of schizophrenia amongst individuals born preterm [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although the etiology of schizophrenia remains elusive, many factors implicated in the pathophysiology of PTB are also implicated in schizophrenia. Notably, infection and inflammation may play a role: maternal infection, in particular influenza [<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and increased levels of maternal circulating cytokines have been associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia development in offspring [<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although the mechanisms linking maternal infection and/or inflammation with the development of schizophrenia remain unclear, studies suggest a reallocation of resources available to the fetus in response to maternal infection may be important [<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The results of an analysis of publicly available Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for schizophrenia by Goudriaan <italic>et al.</italic> suggests dysregulation of cell specific genes in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes may at least partially mediate the schizophrenia phenotype [<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In the perinatal period following PTB, oligodendrocytes are thought to be particularly vulnerable to injury and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypoxic brain injury associated with PTB [<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and astrocytes may at least partially mitigate the excitotoxic insults associated with PTB [<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In a review of the available schizophrenia GWAS, Schmidt-Kastner <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that 55% of genes associated with schizophrenia onset have also been linked to fetal hypoxia response mechanisms [<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], a mechanism implicated in PTB related brain injury which will be discussed in more detail later.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF GLUCOCORTICOID EXPOSURE</title><p>Synthetic glucocorticoids are routinely administered to pregnant women at risk of delivering prematurely [<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] because they reduce death, respiratory distress syndrome and intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants [<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and are safe for mothers [<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. They readily diffuse across the placenta [<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and act to accelerate fetal organ maturation, particularly the lungs. When administered antenatally, the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone has been shown to decrease brain infarct size in a dose-dependent manner [<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], however other studies have reported a decrease in hippocampal neuronal density in post mortem human tissue (mean age 27 weeks) following glucocorticoid exposure [<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Despite this, antenatal glucocorticoid administration was found to have no correlation with later IQ [<xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Glucocorticoids have the ability to block glucose uptake into neurons and glia [<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and within the context of neonatal brain injury, this may be neuroprotective, for example in studies in piglets, <italic>increased</italic> blood glucose levels potentiate the effects of Hypoxia/Ischemia (HI) through increased lactate production [<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Several animal studies also suggest that glucocorticoids may have deleterious effects. The use of betamethasone (another synthetic glucocorticoid) in a PTB sheep model leads to decreased cerebral blood flow, an increased glycolytic response and a decrease in the mature oligodendrocyte population [<xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and dexamethasone exposure reduced expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (a glutamate receptor) in sheep [<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In rodent models, glucocorticoids have a well-established correlation with reduced birth weight [<xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] but this was not seen in a non-human primate model [<xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In mice, where within the cerebellum there is selective expression of the glucocorticoid receptor in the external granule layer, glucocorticoid exposure resulted in an increased level of caspase 3 activation [<xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In this study, caspase 3 staining localized with Ki-67, implying progenitors are susceptible to apoptosis in the cerebellum after glucocorticoid administration [<xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This may be an underlying cause for the decreased cerebellar volume reported on MRI examination of individuals born preterm who had been exposed to postnatal glucocorticoids [<xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>The use of early postnatal glucocorticoids in high dose has been cautioned against [<xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] because of the association with increased incidence of cerebral palsy and other neurodevelopmental disorders as reviewed by Barrington [<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, there remain uncertainties about use of postnatal glucocorticoids for ventilator-dependent preterm infants, who may stand to benefit from earlier extubation without apparent long term morbidity [<xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In animal models, behavioral abnormalities have been seen following post-natal glucocorticoid administration, with an increase in a depression-like phenotype reported in rats [<xref rid="r70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] as well as decreased levels of activity and an altered stress response in adolescent rats (P33) [<xref rid="r71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Although postnatal glucocorticoid administration has been associated with clear adverse consequences [<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], improved outcomes have been reported with low dose post-natal administration in cases of extreme PTB [<xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. There seems to be an undefined time before which glucocorticoid treatment is beneficial and after which glucocorticoid treatment is detrimental.</p></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN PTB-ASSOCIATED DISEASE RISK</title><p>There are differences in outcome between males and females born preterm, with males having a higher incidence of most neurodevelopmental disorders following PTB [<xref rid="r72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Cortical growth and scaling has also been shown to be disrupted by PTB in a sexually dimorphic manner [<xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. There is some evidence to suggest that these differences may be mediated through sex-specific inflammatory responses to PTB. Using dissociated astrocyte cultures from neonatal mice, Santos-Galindo <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated significantly different cytokine expression between male, androgenized female and female astrocytes in response to a Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulus [<xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Potential protective factors in females include early cell proliferation in the hippocampus following neonatal hypoxia-ischaemia which, exceeds that in males [<xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], and female mice have 25-40% more microglia than their male counterparts early in life [<xref rid="r76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], which demonstrates an early imbalance in resource allocation which may be involved in altered inflammatory responses in neonatal brain injury. In male rats, there is specific disruption of early Purkinje cell development in response to inflammation [<xref rid="r77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and following hypoxia-ischemia, male rats show increased ubiquitination of mitochondria and mitophagy in the cortex, in association with impaired expression of electron transport proteins [<xref rid="r78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="r79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Since mitochondria play an integral role in the cellular response to hypoxia, these male specific deficiencies could be important in the sex-specific responses to hypoxia [<xref rid="r80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Using circulating blood samples from pregnant human females, Mitchell <italic>et al.</italic> recently reported an increased maternal cytokine release upon LPS stimulus of immune cells, when pregnant with a female rather than a male fetus. These results imply a mechanism whereby the sex of the fetus may sensitize the maternal immune system to an increased inflammatory response [<xref rid="r81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In clinical trials the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of intraventricular hemorrhage when administered to boys born preterm but had no such effect in girls [<xref rid="r82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="r83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Some of these sex differences may be propagated through epigenetic mechanisms since it has long been known that sex hormones have the potential to alter the epigenome [<xref rid="r84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, <xref rid="r85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] and male/female methylomes differ significantly at many loci throughout development [<xref rid="r86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, <xref rid="r87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS</title><p>Many different definitions of the term &#x0201c;epigenetics&#x0201d; exist, and Adrian Bird&#x02019;s definition of &#x0201c;the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or perpetuate altered activity states&#x0201d; [<xref rid="r88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] is one of the more commonly used modern definitions. For this review, we will primarily focus on the role of DNA cytosine modifications, as well as the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase family of enzymes.</p><sec id="sec5.1"><label>5.1</label><title>DNA Methylation</title><p>DNA methylation typically occurs at the 5<sup>&#x02019;</sup> carbon of cytosine residues, usually when accompanied by a guanine residue in the sequence Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) [<xref rid="r89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], to produce 5-methylcytosine (5mC). Genome wide, roughly 10% of CpG sites are present in clusters called CpG Islands (CGI), which are often located in the promoter regions of key developmentally regulated genes [<xref rid="r89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Although CGIs are generally unmethylated, the presence of 5mC in these areas is typically associated with repression of gene transcription [<xref rid="r90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. DNA methylation is highly conserved from plants to mammals and is widely viewed as a key mechanism in the fine spatial and temporal control of gene expression during development [<xref rid="r89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Low levels of 5mC are generally associated with pluripotency, where less than 30% of CpGs may be methylated as opposed to terminally differentiated cells where up to 85% of CpGs may be methylated [<xref rid="r91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The DNA methyltransferase enzymes DNMT3A and 3B are responsible for <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation [<xref rid="r92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], while DNMT1 is responsible for maintaining the methylation of the complimentary strand during DNA replication [<xref rid="r93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p><p>The Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) enzymes were first proposed to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) from 5mC by Tahiliani <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The three TET proteins (TET1-3) are part of a large group of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase enzymes which also comprises other epigenetic modifiers such as the JMJD1C histone demethylases and the proline hydroxylase (PHD) proteins, (which are involved in the cellular response to hypoxia [<xref rid="r95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]). This group of enzymes are dependent on the TCA cycle metabolite &#x02028;&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate and oxygen as essential substrates and Fe<sup>2+</sup> as an essential co-factor [<xref rid="r96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. TET1 and TET2 have overlapping functions [<xref rid="r97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], a level of redundancy that reflects their biological importance, whilst TET3 is thought to be important during reprogramming within the oocyte [<xref rid="r98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] although it has recently been shown to be important at later developmental stages within the retina [<xref rid="r99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The TET enzymes can be regulated at multiple levels, including through DNA methylation at the TET1 and TET2 promoters [<xref rid="r100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>, <xref rid="r101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], through the action of transcription factors such as HIF1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="r102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], and through regulation at the mRNA and protein level [<xref rid="r103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>-<xref rid="r107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The TET enzymes are therefore highly responsive to environmental stimuli, which perhaps plays a role in their dynamic developmental role.</p><p>The dynamics of 5mC and 5hmC vary throughout development in rodents and humans [<xref rid="r86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. A gradual increase in 5hmC is seen at developmentally primed genes in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as well as in mice at postnatal day (P)7 [<xref rid="r108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. 5hmC levels increase in tandem with cerebellar growth and development, with specific enrichment at genes controlled by FMRP (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein) [<xref rid="r109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. In mouse ESCs, 5hmC is found intragenically at genes which are actively transcribed and at extended promoters of polycomb repressed genes, distinct functions which are due to TET1 interactions with the histone mark H3K4me3 (which is associated with transcriptional activation) or H3K6me3 (associated with transcriptional repression) [<xref rid="r110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. In the adult brain, 5hmC is present throughout gene bodies at much higher levels than in ESCs and for the most part is absent at Transcription Start Sites (TSS), where 5hmC is typically enriched in ESCs [<xref rid="r108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The view of 5hmC as a stable epigenetic modification would imply that there should be mechanisms in place by which the cell can recognize and respond to the presence of 5hmC. These so called &#x02018;5hmC readers&#x02019; have been elusive, with only a handful being characterized to date. Spruijt <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] identified the SRA group of the UHRF2 complex as being able to bind 5hmC and recruit other complexes, while Mellen <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that MeCP2 can bind to 5hmC with high affinity [<xref rid="r112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. There is also evidence to suggest that 5fC and 5caC act as distinct epigenetic marks and have effects on gene transcription [<xref rid="r113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], although research has been somewhat limited because of their relative sparsity in the genome compared to 5mC/5hmC. Thus, since the TET enzymes control transitions between these epigenetic states, alterations of these states through altered TET function could have severe consequences during neonatal brain injury.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.2"><label>5.2</label><title>Histone Modifications</title><p>Histones control the accessibility to DNA of transcription factors and epigenetic readers [<xref rid="r114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>].

A similar study using a subset of the ALSPAC cohort for which epigenomic data from cord blood was available also showed altered DNA methylation at several genes associated with neurodevelopment in association with an increased risk of ADHD, but further added that these changes had disappeared in DNA from peripheral blood samples collected at the age of 7 years [<xref rid="r135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>].

A small longitudinal study examining DNA methylation in blood spots obtained from extremely preterm infants (less than 31 weeks of gestation) at birth and at 18 years&#x02019; old identified several differences in DNA methylation between individuals born at term or preterm at birth [<xref rid="r149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Interestingly this study noted that the differentially methylated regions identified at birth seemed to be controlled by specific transcription factors, perhaps indicating deregulation of transcription factors as a consequence of PTB. In addition, several studies using DNA from umbilical cord blood have shown altered DNA methylation in PTB [<xref rid="r150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>-<xref rid="r152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. These changes may, however, not be permanent; we and others have shown no persistent differences in DNA methylation at candidate genes at one year of age [<xref rid="r153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>] and genome-wide at 18 years [<xref rid="r149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>].</p><p>DNA methylation is dynamic during development, so that studies comparing the methylome at different gestational ages could show differences irrespective of any insults associated with PTB. To address this, a recent study used DNA from buccal cells from PTB neonates collected at term equivalent age, chosen to reflect the allostatic load of preterm birth and neonatal intensive care, in comparison to term born control neonates (n=36/group). DNA methylation was altered in several genes known to be central for neural development [<xref rid="r154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. One of the genes identified as being differentially methylated in PTB, SLC7A5, is a transporter of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [<xref rid="r154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>], mutations of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ASD [<xref rid="r155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. In a mouse model, knockout of SLC7A5 is associated with a behavioural phenotype, which can be partially rescued by intraventricular injection of BCAAs [<xref rid="r155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Genes implicated in other diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (SLC1A2 and APOL1) and altered social processing (NPBWR1) [<xref rid="r154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>] were also found to be differentially methylated.</p><p>In addition to physiological stresses associated with PTB described above, psychological factors may also alter DNA methylation. For example, maternal separation is viewed as a severe early life stressor and increased methylation of the 1-F promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) has been demonstrated in preterm infants following at least 4 days&#x02019; maternal separation [<xref rid="r156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>], which is typical following extreme PTB. Extreme maternal stress has also been associated with increased methylation at NR3C1 [<xref rid="r157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>], with a dose dependent increase in DNA methylation with increasing perceived stress, although gestational age at birth was not accounted for in this study. When examining DNA obtained from a buccal swab of 15 year old adolescents, an increase in global DNA methylation was seen in those who were deemed to have had a more difficult childhood as ascertained through parental questionnaires, although again gestational age at birth was not controlled for [<xref rid="r158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>].</p><p>Considering the relationship between the epigenome and environmental stimuli throughout life, the central issue with examination of post-mortem tissue is the inability to establish cause/consequence. The same caveats hold for the use of peripheral tissue samples which can be collected through a patient&#x02019;s life such as blood, and in addition these samples may have limited predictive value for changes within the brain, given the tissue specificity of epigenetic marks. Recently it has become clear that use of buccal swabs for epigenetic studies is preferable to that of blood [<xref rid="r159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>, <xref rid="r160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>] and a study using circulating blood and saliva samples from an African American population showed that methylation from salivary samples is more comparable to publicly available data sets of methylation in various brain regions [<xref rid="r161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Research into basic mechanisms that might delineate cause and consequence and in the tissue of interest has been somewhat slow in progression, partly due to the lack of a reliable and translatable animal model of PTB.

The TET enzymes and other &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases are particularly susceptible to environmental stimuli. The induction of the hypoxia response machinery through HIF1&#x003b1;, which is central to the cellular response to hypoxia [<xref rid="r162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>] can have long lasting and wide-ranging effects which are known to include epigenetic alterations. Under normoxic conditions, the PHD proteins (part of the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase family) are activated, then cleave and inactivate HIF-1&#x003b1; [<xref rid="r162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Under hypoxic conditions this process is attenuated and HIF-1&#x003b1; forms a heterodimer with HIF-1&#x003b2;, which can then bind DNA and induce hypoxia response genes [<xref rid="r162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Hypoxia can lead to long-term aberrant DNA methylation and shortened dendritic processes in mouse hippocampal cultures, which normalize upon return of normoxia [<xref rid="r163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Pre-treatment with &#x02028;5-Azacytidine (a cytosine analogue that replaces methylated cytosine, thereby depleting 5mC levels) before induction of hypoxia potentiates brain injury in mice, an effect which can be attenuated with HIF-1&#x003b1; inhibition [<xref rid="r164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Hypoxia is associated with significant 5hmC enrichment at genomic HIF-1&#x003b1; binding sites and the TET enzymes are necessary for this induction [<xref rid="r102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. A TET2-mediated increase in global 5hmC was seen in adult mice upon occlusion of the middle cerebral artery as a model of HI induction [<xref rid="r165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>], although this finding is yet to be replicated in neonatal animals. During neonatal brain injury there is a coordinated inflammatory response, which can last weeks after the initial insult, leading to increased levels of TNF&#x003b1; [<xref rid="r166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. TNF&#x003b1; upregulates NF&#x003ba;B which binds the promoter of HIF-1&#x003b1; and increases its transcription under normoxic conditions [<xref rid="r167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. This provides a plausible link between inflammation and activation of the hypoxia response system, which could be important in the context of PTB where fluctuating oxygen levels can co-occur with inflammation (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec id="sec8.2"><label>8.2</label><title>TCA Cycle Dysregulation</title><p>In addition to the requirement of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate for activity of the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases, other components of the TCA cycle can impact on their activity: for example both succinate and fumarate can act as inhibitors of TET function [<xref rid="r170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. The reactions of the TCA cycle are summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>)</xref>.

Further, several TCA cycle reactions may undergo shifts in their direction of action resulting in increased succinate production [<xref rid="r172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Indeed, succinate increases during hypoxia outside the nervous system [<xref rid="r173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>], although it is unclear whether this also occurs in the brain, since several studies have found no evidence for succinate accumulation in astrocytes dissociated and cultured from 3 week old mice [<xref rid="r174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. This may be due to the sequestration of &#x02028;&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate into glutamate production due to the massive extracellular release of glutamate which occurs during hypoxia-ischemia, resulting in the depletion of intracellular glutamate [<xref rid="r175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. In mice, pre-treatment with &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate or oxaloacetate is protective against subsequent administration of the excitotoxic agent Kainic acid [<xref rid="r176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Further, administration of succinyl-phosphonate, which inhibits OGDH (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) leading to increased cellular &#x02028;&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate, protects cultured cerebellar neurons against glutamate induced excitotoxicity [<xref rid="r177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>].

Inhibition of the OGDH complex has been shown to protect against excitotoxic mediated cell death in cerebellar granule cells [<xref rid="r177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. The pathogenesis of the excitotoxic insult after hypoxia-ischaemia is partly mediated by the AMPA GluR2 receptor, expression of which has been directly associated with degree of hypoxic ischemic damage in both rats [<xref rid="r179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>] and human post-mortem tissue [<xref rid="r180" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>].

Instead, glutamate may be preferentially recycled to reform more glutamate rather than entering the TCA cycle and &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate already in the TCA cycle may be diverted to glutamate formation at the expense of the TCA cycle and the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases.</p><p>During severe ischemia, the main mechanism increasing glutamate within the synapse is reversed uptake of astrocytic transporters due to altered ionic gradients [<xref rid="r184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. This is important as it outlines an excitotoxic cycle whereby ATP cannot be produced in sufficient quantities due to hypoxia and therefore glutamate uptake, which is an energy intensive process, cannot occur. This leads to further receptor activation and an increased flux of Na<sup>+</sup> out of the cell, further driving ionic gradients towards reverse uptake of glutamate and depletion of intracellular glutamate stores, which could lead to altered availability of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate. This could be important, since the TET enzymes are particularly susceptible to &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate fluctuations due to a relatively low Km (the concentration of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate which is necessary to produce half of the maximum velocity of TET meditated hydroxymethylation) [<xref rid="r170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>], although a key question is whether alterations in sub-cellular localizations of &#x02028;&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate during PTB related excitotoxicity and/or &#x02028;&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate sequestration to glutamate production can alter &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate levels sufficiently in the nucleus to affect activity of the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.4"><label>8.4</label><title>Inflammation</title><p>It has been postulated that the epigenetic alterations that occur in association with ASD may have inflammatory origins, as reviewed by Nardone and Elliot [<xref rid="r185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>].

Astrocytes are central to the excitotoxic response, which involves glutamate recycling and its <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. Oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) are vulnerable to oxidative stress and other factors associated with hypoxia, inflammation and excitotoxicity as periods critical for their correct maturation and development overlap with the time during which PTB related insults may occur [<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="r168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>] (surface area of an individual OPC&#x02019;s membrane can increase up to 6,500 fold during these times [<xref rid="r169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]). The death of OPCs is of particular importance during development as this leads to a shortage of mature oligodendrocytes which may result in aberrant myelination in deep white matter tracts of the brain, leading to impaired signalling and neuronal death, which can be seen pathologically as periventricular leukomalacia, an anatomical feature of cerebral palsy. Microglia can become activated in response to infection in utero or postnatally, this population transition is central to the inflammatory response within the CNS and increased levels of microglial activation can also be seen in post-mortem ASD tissue in the prefrontal cortex of male patients [<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CG-19-507_F1"/></fig><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. (2)</label><caption><p>During normoxia the TCA cycle has many reversible reactions with 2 &#x0201c;stop/go&#x0201d; points of irreversible reactions, at the conversion of oxaloacetate to citrate and likewise the conversion of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA. During hypoxia, as the cell needs ATP and NAD+, the TCA metabolite flow predominately proceeds towards succinate production from &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate to account for ATP lost from electron transport failure and oxaloacetate is preferentially converted to malate to increase mitochondrial NAD. This leads to a build-up of fumarate and succinate which are known to inhibit the function of the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases. It has also been shown that under hypoxic conditions &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate can be converted, primarily by lactate dehydrogenase, to L-hydroxyglutarate, which also can inhibit members of the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase family. The metabolites which have been shown to either directly promote (&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate) or inhibit (succinate, fumarate and L-hydroxyglutarate) activity of the &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases are highlighted in bold.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CG-19-507_F2"/></fig></floats-group></article>
