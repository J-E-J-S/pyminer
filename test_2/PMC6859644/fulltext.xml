Recent technological advances in single-cell methodologies have resulted in an increased capacity to study cell-to-cell heterogeneity and the underlying molecular regulatory programs that drive such variation.</p><p id="Par5">To date, most single-cell profiling efforts have been performed via quantification of RNA by sequencing (scRNA-seq). While this provides snapshots of inter- and intra-cellular variability in gene expression, investigation of the <italic>epigenomic</italic> landscape in single cells holds great promise for uncovering an important component of the regulatory logic of gene expression programs. Enabled by advances in array-based technologies, droplet microfluidics, and combinatorial indexing through split-pooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) has recently overcome previous limitations of technology and scale to generate chromatin accessibility data for thousands of single cells in a relatively easy and cost-effective manner.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic overview of single-cell ATAC-seq assays and analysis steps. <bold>a</bold> Single-cell ATAC libraries are created from single cells that have been exposed to the Tn5 transposase using one of the following three protocols: (1) Single cells are individually barcoded by a split-and-pool approach where unique barcodes added at each step can be used to identify reads originating from each cell, (2) microfluidic droplet-based technologies provided by 10X Genomics and BioRad are used to extract and label DNA from each cell, or (3) each single cell is deposited into a multi-well plate or array from ICELL8 or Fluidigm C1 for library preparation. <bold>b</bold> After sequencing, the raw reads obtained in .fastq format for each single cell are mapped to a reference genome, producing aligned reads in .bam format. Finally, peak calling and read counting return the genomic position and the read count files in. bed and .txt format, respectively. Data in these file formats is then used for downstream analysis. <bold>c</bold> ATAC-seq peaks in bulk samples can generally be recapitulated in aggregated single-cell samples, but not every single cell has a fragment at every peak. A feature matrix can be constructed from single cells (e.g., by counting the number of reads at each peak for every cell). <bold>d</bold> Following the construction of the feature matrix, common downstream analyses including visualization, clustering, trajectory inference, determination of differential accessibility, and the prediction of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory networks can be performed using the methods benchmarked in this manuscript</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2019_1854_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">However, the analysis of scATAC-seq data presents methodological challenges distinct from those of single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) data. The primary difficulty arises from a difference in the number of RNA vs DNA molecules available for profiling in single cells. While for an expressed gene several RNA molecules are present in a single cell, scATAC-seq assays profile DNA, a molecule which is present in only few copies per cell (two in a diploid organism). The low copy number results in an inherent per-cell data sparsity, where only 1&#x02013;10% of expected accessible peaks are detected in single cells from scATAC-seq data (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1), compared to 10&#x02013;45% of expressed genes detected in single cells from scRNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This emphasizes the need to recover informative features from sparse data to assess variability between cells in scATAC-seq analyses. Further, determination of which features best define cell state is currently unclear.</p><p id="Par7">The difference in readout (gene expression vs chromatin accessibility) has also motivated a variety of approaches to selecting informative features in scATAC-seq methods. While most processing pipelines share common upstream processing steps (i.e., alignment, peak calling, and counting; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), existing computational approaches differ in the way they obtain a feature matrix for downstream analyses. For example, some methods select features based on the sequence content of accessible regions (e.g., <italic>k</italic>-mer frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or transcription factor (TF) motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]), whereas other methods select features based on the genomic coordinates of the accessible regions (e.g., extended promoter regions to determine chromatin activity surrounding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). Finally, the potential feature set in scATAC-seq, which includes genome-wide regions of accessible chromatin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), is typically 10&#x02013;20&#x000d7; the size of the feature set in scRNA-seq experiments (which is defined and limited by the number of genes expressed). This larger feature set could be valuable in distinguishing a wider variety of cell populations and inferring the dynamics underlying cell organization into complex tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the novelty and assay-specific challenges associated with these large-scale scATAC-seq datasets and the lack of analysis guidelines have resulted in diverging computational strategies to aggregate data across such an immense feature space with no clear indication as to which strategy or strategies are most advantageous.</p><p id="Par8">Here, we provide the first benchmark assessment of computational methods for the analysis of scATAC-seq data. We discuss the impact of feature matrix construction strategies (e.g., sequence content-based vs genomic coordinates) on common downstream analysis, with a focus on clustering and visualization. This comprehensive survey of current available methods provides user-specific recommendations for best practices that aim to maximize inference capability for current and future scATAC-seq workflows. Importantly, we provide more than 100 well-documented Jupyter Notebooks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pinellolab/scATAC-benchmarking/">https://github.com/pinellolab/scATAC-benchmarking/</ext-link>) to easily reproduce our analyses. We anticipate that this will be a valuable resource for future scATAC-seq benchmark studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Benchmark framework</title><p id="Par9">For this benchmarking study, we created an unbiased framework to qualitatively and quantitatively survey the ability of available scATAC-seq methods to featurize chromatin accessibility data. Using this framework we evaluated several datasets of divergent size and profiling technologies. Using widely accepted quantitative metrics, we explored how differences in feature matrix construction influence outcomes in exploratory visualization and clustering, two common downstream analyses. The general overview of our framework is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Benchmarking workflow. Starting from aligned read files in .bam format, feature matrices were constructed using each method. The feature matrix construction techniques used by each method were grouped into four broad categories: <italic>define regions</italic>, <italic>count features</italic>, <italic>transformation</italic>, and <italic>dimensionality reduction</italic>. A colored dot under a technique indicates that the method (signified by the respective color in the legend on the right) uses that technique. For each method, feature matrix files (defined as columns as cells and rows as features) are calculated and used to perform hierarchical, Louvain, and k-means clustering analysis. For datasets with a ground truth such as FACS-sorting labels or known tissues, clustering evaluation was performed according to the adjusted Rand index (ARI), adjusted mutual information (AMI), and homogeneity (H) scores. For datasets without ground truth, the clustering solutions were evaluated according to a Residual Average Gini Index (RAGI), a metric that compares cluster separation based on known marker genes against housekeeping genes. Lastly, a final score is assigned to each method</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2019_1854_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">For this study, we collected public data from three published studies (aligned files in BAM format) and generated ten simulated datasets with various coverages and noise levels (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section). To calculate feature matrices for downstream analysis, for each method, we followed the guidelines provided in the documentation in the original study or as suggested by the respective authors. After feature matrix construction, we used three commonly used clustering approaches (K-means, Louvain, and hierarchical clustering) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and UMAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] projection to find putative subpopulations and visualize cell-to-cell similarities for each method. Next, the quality of the clustering solutions was evaluated by adjusted Rand index (ARI), adjusted mutual information (AMI), and homogeneity (H) when FACS-sorting labels or tissues were available (gold standard) or by a proposed Gini-index-based metric called Residual Average Gini Index (RAGI) when only known marker genes were available (silver standard). Finally, based on these metrics, the methods were ranked by the quality of their clustering solutions across datasets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods overview and featurization of chromatin accessibility data</title><p id="Par11">Several computational methods have been developed to address the inherent sparsity and high dimensionality of single-cell ATAC-seq data, including BROCKMAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], chromVAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], Cicero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], cisTopic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], Gene Scoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], scABC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Scasat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], SCRAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and SnapATAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Based on the proposed workflow of each method, we computed different feature matrices defined as a features-by-cells matrix (e.g., read counts for each cell (columns) in a given open chromatin peak <italic>feature</italic> (rows)) that could then be readily used for downstream analyses such as clustering. Starting from single-cell BAM files, the feature matrix construction can be roughly summarized into four different common modules: <italic>define regions</italic>, <italic>count features</italic>, <italic>transformation</italic>, <italic>and dimensionality reduction</italic> as illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Not every method uses all steps; therefore, we provide below, a short summary of the strategies adopted by each method and a <italic>per module</italic> discussion to highlight key similarities and differences (for a more detailed description of each strategy, see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section).</p><p id="Par12">Briefly, BROCKMAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] represents genomic sequences by gapped k-mers (short DNA sequences of length <italic>k</italic>) within transposon integration sites and infers the variation in k-mer occupancy using principal component analysis (PCA). chromVAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] estimates the dispersion of chromatin accessibility within peaks sharing the same feature, e.g., motifs or k-mers. Cicero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] calculates a gene activity score based on accessibility at a promoter region and the regulatory potential of peaks nearby. cisTopic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] applies latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (a Bayesian topic modeling approach commonly used in natural language processing) to identify cell states from topic-cell distribution and explore <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions from region-topic distribution. Previous approaches that utilize latent semantic indexing (LSI) (termed here as <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) first partition the genome into windows, normalize reads within windows using the term frequency-inverse document frequency transformation (TF-IDF), reduce dimensionality using singular value decomposition (SVD), and perform a first-round of clustering (referred to as &#x0201c;in silico cell sorting&#x0201d;) to generate clades and call peaks within them. Finally, the clusters are refined with a second-round of clustering after TF-IDF and SVD based on read counts in peaks. The Gene Scoring method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] assigns each gene an accessibility score by summarizing peaks near its transcription start site (TSS) and weighting them by an exponential decay function based on their distances to the TSS. scABC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] first calculates a global weight for each cell by taking into account the number of distinct reads in the regions flanking peaks (to estimate the expected background). Based on these weights, it then uses weighted k-medoids to cluster cells based on the reads in peaks. Scasat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] binarizes peak accessibility and uses multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on the Jaccard distance to reduce dimensionality before clustering. SCRAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] summarizes read counts on different regulatory features (e.g., transcription factor binding motifs, gene TSS regions). SnapATAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] segments the genome into uniformly sized bins and adjusts for differences in library size between cells using a regression-based normalization method; finally, PCA is performed to select the most significant components for clustering analysis.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Define regions</title><p id="Par13">An essential aspect of feature matrix construction is the selection of a set of regions to describe the data (e.g., putative regulatory elements such as peaks and promoters). Most methods described above, including chromVAR, Cicero, cisTopic, Gene Scoring, scABC, and Scasat, define regions based on peak calling from either a reference bulk ATAC-seq profile or an aggregated single-cell ATAC-seq profile. <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic>, as briefly mentioned above, instead of aggregating single cell to call peaks, first creates pseudo-bulk clades by performing hierarchical clustering on the TF-IDF and SVD transformed matrix using the top frequently accessible windows. Then, peaks are called by aggregating cells within each pseudo-bulk clade. In addition to relying on peaks, some methods have proposed different strategies. BROCKMAN uses the union of regions around transposon integration sites. <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> (before in silico sorting) and SnapATAC segment the genomes into fixed-size bins (windows) and count features within each bin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Count features</title><p id="Par14">Once feature regions are defined, raw features within these regions are counted. Note that some methods (e.g., chromVAR) may support the counting of multiple features. For cisTopic, <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic>, scABC, and Scasat, reads overlapping peaks are counted. For <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> (before the in silico sorting step) and SnapATAC, reads overlapping bins are counted. k-mers are counted under peaks for chromVAR while gapped k-mers are counted for BROCKMAN around transposase cut sites. Similarly, transcription factor motifs (e.g., from the JASPAR database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) can be used as features by counting reads overlapping their binding sites in peaks (chromVAR) or genome-wide (SCRAT). If pre-defined genomic annotations such as coding genes are given, Gene Scoring, Cicero, and SCRAT use gene TSSs as anchor points to calculate gene enrichment scores based on reads nearby or just within peaks nearby.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Transformation</title><p id="Par15">After building the initial raw feature matrix using the counting step, different transformation methods can be performed. Binarization of read counts is used by five out of the ten evaluated methods: Cicero, cisTopic, <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic>, Scasat, and SnapATAC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This step is based on the assumption that each site is present at most twice (for diploid genomes) and that the count matrix is inherently sparse. Binarization is advantageous in alleviating challenges arising from sequencing depth or PCR amplification artifacts. SnapATAC and Scasat convert the binary count matrix into a cell-pairwise Jaccard index similarity matrix. <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> normalizes the binary count matrix using the TF-IDF transformation. Cicero weights feature sites by their co-accessibility, while Gene Scoring weights sites by a decaying function based on its distance to a gene TSS. Both chromVAR and SnapATAC perform a read coverage bias correction to account for the influence of sample depth. chromVAR creates &#x0201c;background&#x0201d; peaks consisting of an equal number of peaks matched for both average accessibility and GC content to calculate bias-corrected deviation while SnapATAC uses a regression-based method to mitigate the coverage difference between cells.&#x000a0;scABC also implements a similar step by calculating a weight for each cell, but these weights are not used to transform the matrix; instead they are used later in the clustering procedure. Both BROCKMAN and chromVAR compute <italic>z</italic>-scores to measure the gain or loss of chromatin accessibility across cells.&#x000a0;SCRAT adjusts for both library size and region length.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Dimensionality reduction</title><p id="Par16">In the final step before downstream analysis, several methods apply different dimensionality reduction techniques to project the cells into a space of fewer dimensions. This step can refine the feature space mitigating redundant features and potential artifacts and potentially reducing the computation time of downstream analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). PCA is the most commonly used method (used by BROCKMAN, SnapATAC, and <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic>). cisTopic uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to generate two distributions including topic-cell distribution and region-topic distribution. Choosing the top topics based on the topic-cell distribution reduces the dimensionality. Scasat uses multidimensional scaling (MDS). When reviewing the different methods to include in our benchmark, we noticed that not all methods perform a dimensionality reduction step, which could skew the relative performance across methods. Therefore, for chromVAR, Cicero (gene activity score), Gene Scoring, scABC, and SCRAT, we considered, in addition to the original feature matrix, also a new feature matrix after PCA transformation, since this is a simple and commonly used technique for dimensionality reduction.</p><p id="Par17">To better evaluate the effects of different modules including <italic>define regions</italic>, <italic>count features</italic>, <italic>transformation</italic>, and <italic>dimensionality reduction</italic>, we also considered a simple control method, referred to as Control-Na&#x000ef;ve, by combining the most common and simple steps for building a feature matrix, i.e., counting reads within peaks to obtain a peaks-by-cells raw count matrix and then performing PCA on it (the number of top principal components was determined based on the elbow plot for all the methods). Since the feature matrix of scABC is also a peaks-by-cells raw count matrix, this matrix after PCA will correspond to the one obtained by the Control-Na&#x000ef;ve method (to avoid redundancies, in our assessment, we refer to this matrix as Control-Na&#x000ef;ve).</p><p id="Par18">We also noticed that some methods might slightly diverge from the proposed four modules common framework. For example, Cicero calculates gene activity scores by first performing two transformations (binarize and weight features) and then performing the counting step around the annotated TSS. We believe the proposed modularization of the feature matrix construction can still serve as a useful framework to represent the core components of the different methods and provides an intuitive and informative summary of the diverse scATAC-seq methodologies.</p><p id="Par19">Once dimensionality reduction is completed, the transformed feature matrix can be used for unbiased clustering, visualization, or other downstream analyses. Here, we have used the final feature matrices generated by each scATAC-seq analysis method and evaluated their performance in uncovering different populations by unsupervised clustering.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Clustering approaches and metrics used for performance evaluation</title><p id="Par20">This study employed three diverse types of commonly used unsupervised clustering methods for single-cell analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and the Louvain community detection algorithm (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section).</p><p id="Par21">Clustering results were evaluated by three commonly used metrics: adjusted Rand index (ARI), adjusted mutual information (AMI), and homogeneity, when a gold standard solution was available (known labels for the simulation data and FACS-sorted cell populations or known tissues for the real datasets).

Briefly, to generate the peaks-by-cells matrices, we defined a noise parameter (between 0 and 1) as the proportion of reads occurring in a random peak from one of the sorted populations. The remaining proportion of reads was distributed as a function of the bulk sample (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section). A feature matrix with a noise level of 0 preserved perfectly the underlying cell type specificity of the reads within peaks. Conversely, a feature matrix with a noise level of 1 contained no information to discriminate cell types based on the reads within peaks. In our study, we considered three noise levels: no noise (0), moderate noise (0.2), and high noise (0.4).

Scasat performed slightly better than the Control-Na&#x000ef;ve method, and the remaining methods underperformed relative to the Control-Na&#x000ef;ve method. For scABC (i.e., peaks-by-cells raw count matrix), hierarchical clustering performs much better than the other two clustering methods. chromVAR performance using k-mers as features was superior to the approach using motifs. Another k-mer-based method, BROCKMAN, demonstrated similar performance to the k-mer-based chromVAR method. Motif-based SCRAT performed better than motif-based chromVAR. Both Cicero gene activity scores and Gene Scoring (which summarize the chromatin accessibility around coding annotations without a dimensionality reduction step) generally performed poorly. PCA boosted the performance of scABC, Cicero, and Gene Scoring. This step improved clustering performance regardless of the clustering method (also we noted again that scABC after PCA is equivalent to the Control-Na&#x000ef;ve method), especially for the Louvain approach. PCA also slightly boosted the performance of the k-mer-based chromVAR but did not markedly improve the results of the motif-based chromVAR or SCRAT analyses.

We observed that after running PCA, k-mer-based chromVAR can recover an additional group of cells within the lung tissue and also detect finer structure within the cells from the brain. Compared with k-mer-based features, motif-based chromVAR and its combination with PCA transformation distinguished fewer tissue groups while mixing more cells from different tissues. BROCKMAN recovered a continuous structure with the different tissues but does not distinguish them clearly. Similarly, Gene Scoring put cells from different tissues into a big bulk population with limited separation. PCA improved its ability to separate out a few tissues, including the liver, heart, and kidney. SCRAT and Cicero gene activity scores mixed most of the cells from different tissues and performed poorly on this dataset with or without PCA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Clustering performance summary</title><p id="Par51">To assess and compare the overall performance of scATAC-seq analysis methods, we ranked the methods based on each metric (ARI, AMI, homogeneity, RAGI) by taking the best clustering solution for the three real datasets (<italic>Buenrostro2018</italic> dataset, 10X PBMCs dataset, and the downsampled <italic>sci-ATAC-seq mouse</italic> dataset) and two synthetic datasets (simulated bone marrow dataset and simulated erythropoiesis dataset with the moderate noise level of 0.2 and a medium coverage of 2500 fragments per cell). Then, for each dataset except for the 10X PBMC dataset, we calculated the average rank across ARI, AMI, and homogeneity. For the 10X PBMC dataset, RAGI is calculated instead (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S14a). Lastly, we calculated the average rank across different datasets.

We also observed that chromVAR performs better in real datasets than in simulated datasets and that the k-mer-based version of chromVAR consistently outperforms motif-based chromVAR. For the methods that do not implement dimensionality reduction, the PCA step does not always improve the performance except for scABC and Cicero, in which the PCA transformation consistently boosts the results.

To make a thorough assessment of how the first PC affects the clustering results, we compared the effect of keeping vs removing the first PC on the three real datasets (for this comparison, we consider both the methods that implemented PCA and the combination of PCA and the methods that did not implement a dimensionality reduction step) (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S15). Across all three datasets, we observe that for Control-Na&#x000ef;ve, BROCKMAN, SCRAT-PCA, and Gene Scoring-PCA, removing the first PC consistently helped in better separating the different populations in UMAP projections and improved clustering performance. In contrast, the performance of chromVAR-PCA with motifs as features consistently dropped after removing the first PC. <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> and SnapATAC performed similarly before and after removing the first PC across all datasets. For Cicero-PCA, removing the first PC did not clearly affect its performance in <italic>Buenrostro2018</italic> and 10X PBMCs datasets but improved its performance in the downsampled sci-ATAC mouse dataset.</p><p id="Par54">Generally, the methods that implement binarization (e.g., <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic>, SnapATAC) or that implement cell coverage bias correction (e.g., chromVAR, SnapATAC) tend to be less affected by the sample sequencing depths. Therefore, for these methods, we believe that the first PC does not capture the library size and removing it does not help to improve the clustering results. On the contrary, for methods that do not implement any specific step to correct for potential artifacts associated with sequencing depth, the first PC is more likely to capture biologically irrelevant factors and therefore may reduce biology-driven differences. However, this operation must be applied with caution, since removing the first component could also in some cases remove some biological variation (e.g., motif-based chromVAR).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Clustering performance when running methods as end-to-end pipelines</title><p id="Par55">When designing this study, we reasoned that a benchmark procedure could be approached from two very different perspectives. The first is the end user perspective, i.e., a user that runs a method as a black box following the provided documentation with the goal to obtain a reasonable clustering solution without worrying too much about the internal design choices and procedures. In these settings, it is not trivial to systematically compare the methods and understand which part related to the featurization may influence the final clustering performance, especially if also the clustering algorithms used are different. The second perspective that was used instead in the rest of this benchmarking effort is the developer perspective, i.e., we tried to understand what are the key steps of each method that can boost clustering performance of common clustering approaches. Regardless, we reasoned that it is important to provide some insights on the user perspective, since some readers will use the tested methods as end-to-end pipelines. Therefore, we also compared the clustering solutions produced by running the complete analysis pipelines as outlined in tutorials for the methods that explicitly implement a clustering step (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Note S6). We evaluated the clustering results using ARI, AMI, and homogeneity for the <italic>Buenrostro2018</italic> and sci-ATAC-seq mouse datasets and RAGI for the 10X&#x000a0;PBMCs dataset (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S16-S18). We observe the top three methods, i.e., <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic>, cisTopic, and SnapATAC, still outperform the other methods but with a slightly different ranking (<italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> is ranked first followed by cisTopic and SnapATAC, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S14b). Also, both scABC and Cicero performed better than Scasat in this analysis. Interestingly, we observed that SnapATAC, cisTopic, <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic>, and Scasat have even better clustering solutions in our benchmarking framework compared to using their own clustering approach. On the other hand, scABC and Cicero had better clustering results when running their own clustering procedure. scABC uses an unsupervised clustering method tailored to single-cell epigenomic data (including scATAC-seq). Although it uses the na&#x000ef;ve peaks-by-cells raw count as its feature matrix, it calculates cells&#x02019; weights by considering their sequencing coverage and giving more weight to cells with higher number of reads. Also, it performs two steps of clustering by using weighted k-medoid algorithm based on Spearman rank correlation to find landmarks first and then assigns cells to the landmarks. These specific steps help improve its clustering performance. For the Cicero clustering workflow, we used the gene activity scores and, as proposed in their tutorial, functions from Monocle2, to (i) normalize the scores and (ii) reduce the dimensionality with t-SNE by using the top PCs before clustering cells. These extra steps helped in improving its clustering solutions. This suggests that appropriate normalization steps need to be properly performed to improve clustering analysis, in addition to simple transformations like binarizing counts and/or performing a PCA.</p><p id="Par56">Taken together, based on these analyses, we recommend using SnapATAC, cisTopic, or <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> to cluster cells in meaningful subpopulations.

The first strategy (pseudo-bulk from all single cells, PB-All) for inferring peaks is to call peaks on a pseudo-bulk sample composed of all the reads from all cells in the library. The second (pseudo-bulk from FACS, PB-FACS) is to call peaks in a priori-defined cell types isolated by FACS sorting.

Consequently, as these peaks would be vastly underrepresented in a consensus peak set, virtually all computational algorithms will fail to identify rare populations.

We selected this number reasoning that a typical lab may not have access to a machine with 44 cores and instead may use a mid-size computing node with 8&#x02013;12 cores. Notably, SnapATAC was the only method capable of processing the full sci-ATAC-seq mouse dataset (~&#x02009;80,000 single cells).</p><p id="Par72">As shown in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S24, BROCKMAN and SCRAT have the largest execution times in all the real datasets while the methods that use a custom script to obtain a peaks-by-cells matrix tend to have shorter execution times (e.g., Scasat, <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic>, Gene Scoring).</p><p id="Par73">We also assessed the scalability of methods with respect to the increasing coverage (250, 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000 fragments per peaks).

However, the sparsity of scATAC-seq datasets provides unique challenges that must be addressed in order to perform essential analyses such as cluster identification, visualization, and trajectory inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, the rapid technological innovations that facilitate profiling accessible chromatin landscapes of 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup> cells provide additional computational challenges to efficiently store and analyze data.</p><p id="Par76">In this study, we compared ten computational methods developed to construct informative feature matrices for the downstream analysis of scATAC-seq data. We developed a uniform processing framework that ranks methods based on their ability to discriminate cell types when combined with three common unsupervised clustering approaches, followed by evaluation of three well-accepted clustering metrics. We evaluated these methods on 13 datasets, three of those obtained using different technologies (Fluidigm C1, 10X, and sci-ATAC) and five consisting of simulated data with varying noise levels. These datasets comprise cells from different tissues in both mouse and human.</p><p id="Par77">In addition to identifying various methodologies that perform optimally on real and simulated data, our benchmarking examination of scATAC-seq methodologies reveals general principles that will inform the development of future algorithms. First, peak-level or bin-level feature counting generally performs better in distinguishing different cell types followed in turn by k-mer-level, TF motif-level, and gene-centric-level summarization. We interpret this finding as an indication of the complexity of gene regulatory circuits where precise enhancer elements may have distinct functions that cannot be sufficiently approximated by sequence context or proximity to gene bodies alone. Second, we note that the methods that implement a dimensionality reduction step generally perform better in the separation of cell types, since this step may help to remove the redundancy between a large number of raw features and to mitigate the effect of noise. Third, for the methods that do not implement a dimensionality reduction step, simply adding a PCA step could significantly improve the clustering results. In fact, PCA generally boosts Louvain clustering results. For methods that do not account for the differing sequencing coverage of cells, the first PC could be used to capture and correct for sample depth differences. In this case, removing the first PC may improve the performance of these methods. Fourth, we observe that the Louvain method overall performs more consistently and accurately than k-means and hierarchical clustering. In contrast, k-means and hierarchical clustering are more sensitive to outliers and may result in suboptimal clustering solutions since some of clusters may correspond to single or few outlier cells. Fifth, the robustness of different methods to noise and coverage varies among different datasets. Among the top three methods, cisTopic is the most penalized by low coverage. Sixth, it was also observed that inappropriate transformations, such as log2 transformation and normalization based on region size as implemented in SCRAT, may impact negatively clustering performance.</p><p id="Par78">We observe that many methods fail to scale to larger datasets, which are now available due to improvements in split-pool technology and droplet microfluidics. As technologies improve and individual labs and international consortia lead efforts to generate ever larger single-cell datasets, scalability will be an unavoidable goal of method developments on a par with accuracy. As many of our evaluated methods were designed in the context of data generated from the Fluidigm C1 platform (which produces ~&#x02009;10<sup>2</sup> cells), such approaches were often incapable of analyzing large datasets. In particular, the sci-ATAC-seq mouse dataset served as a useful resource to test the scalability of the methods that were benchmarked (~&#x02009;80,000 cells). Notably, our evaluation demonstrates that only SnapATAC was able to scale to process and analyze this large dataset. Future methods must be capable of processing datasets of this size especially adopting efficient data structures that allow out of core computing. Our findings reinforce the need for methods that not only are accurate but highly scalable for scATAC-seq data processing.</p><p id="Par79">Defining regions is an important step in constructing feature matrices. Selecting informative regions generally improves downstream analyses such as clustering to capture heterogeneity within cell populations. Peak calling is a popular and straightforward way to define regions of interest. We observe that clustering performance is not generally impacted by using peaks defined from bulk ATAC-seq data vs using peaks obtained from aggregating single-cell data based on FACS-sorting labels. However, performing peak calling by simply pooling reads from single cells may obfuscate peaks specific to rare cell populations leading to failures in uncovering them. In addition, the <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> approach to identify pseudo-bulk clades is a promising unsupervised way to perform in silico sorting without relying on FACS-sorting labels. This strategy potentially serves as a suitable way to preserve peaks specific to rare cell types. Also choosing an appropriate number of peaks is important for improving the downstream analysis (for example based on intensity/frequency-based given that they perform similarly).</p><p id="Par80">We are aware of the current limitations in our benchmarking effort. We have compared single-cell ATAC-seq methods based on their ability to separate discrete cell populations; however, this might not be ideal when dealing with a continuous cell lineage landscape. We observe that chromVAR generally works better in preserving a continuous space while SnapATAC tends to break a putative landscape into discrete populations. The choice of method is ultimately case-specific and may be driven by the downstream application. For example, the feature matrix obtained by chromVAR may be more suitable for trajectory inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] while the one obtained from SnapATAC may be more appropriate to better identify discrete and well-separated cell populations by clustering. We acknowledge also that not all tested methods were specifically designed to produce clustering results. For example, chromVAR, Cicero, and Gene Scoring were designed to determine important marker genes and their regulatory logic or to infer enriched TF binding sites within accessible chromatin regions. However, because clustering is a critical part of single-cell analysis and researchers frequently use output from all methods to produce clustering results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], we felt that evaluating the clustering abilities using feature matrices produced by each method was a useful measure. An additional limitation of our study is that it is impossible to create a simulation framework that models an experimental outcome with perfect accuracy. Several assumptions were made to enable our simulation of the data; these assumptions are described in the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section, where we detail explicitly how the simulated data was generated.</p><p id="Par81">Interestingly, we learnt that some combinations of feature matrices with the simple clustering approaches included in our benchmarking framework perform even better than the original combination proposed by the respective authors. This highlights the value of this dual-characterization (<italic>user</italic> vs <italic>designer perspective</italic>) and provides a summary of both perspectives to the readers.</p><p id="Par82">We believe it is important to stress the distinction between biological realities and computational performance, especially in the context of unsupervised clustering. A big and critical assumption (or hope) of our field is that an unsupervised clustering procedure will provide clustering solutions that recapitulate different populations corresponding to different cell types/states. Given that for several real datasets the ground truth is not known, a current compromise during the exploratory clustering analysis is to use known marker genes, sorted populations, or known tissues to validate the clustering solutions based on classic metrics. If we embrace this assumption, keeping in mind that additional validation is required to truly delineate the subpopulation structure of a population of cells, the two views, biological and computational, can be reconciled. Our benchmark procedure is aimed to provide some guidelines based on explorative analyses that are currently adopted in several published papers.</p><p id="Par83">Looking forward, due to the wealth of data being produced by new scATAC technologies, we hypothesize that more powerful machine learning frameworks may be able to uncover complex <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> relationships that define cell-cell relatedness. Specifically, we anticipate autoencoder-like models that integrate genomic sequence context, gene body positions, and precise accessible chromatin information will yield information-rich features and that more advanced manifold learning methods will help to remove redundancy and better preserve heterogeneity within single-cell populations. Such achievements may enable us to overcome the inherent sparsity and high dimensionality that characterizes scATAC-seq data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par84">Our benchmarking results highlight SnapATAC, cisTopic, and <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> as the top performing scATAC-seq data analysis methods to perform clustering across all datasets and different metrics. Methods that preserve information at the peak level (cisTopic, <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic>, Scasat) or bin level (SnapATAC) generally outperform those that summarize accessible chromatin regions at the motif/k-mer level (chromVAR, BROCKMAN, SCRAT) or over the gene body (Cicero, Gene Scoring). In addition, methods that implement a dimensionality reduction step (BROCKMAN, cisTopic, <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic>, Scasat, SnapATAC) generally show advantages over the other methods without this important step. SnapATAC is the most scalable method; it was the only method capable of processing more than 80,000 cells. <italic>Cusanovich2018</italic> is the method that best balances analysis performance and running time.</p><p id="Par85">Based on the presented analyses, we showed that a few methods outperformed others in terms of clustering performances and running time. However, we believe that a method based on the combination of modules used in the best methods may outperform them. In support of this idea, we found that simply altering the normalization step or clustering approach significantly improved the downstream clustering performance of some methods. With this in mind, we believe it may be possible to build a &#x0201c;maybe best&#x0201d; scATAC-seq computational method by adopting the most impactful modules from the best-performing methods evaluated. Such modules include (1) defining features as peaks/fixed-size bins, (2) count peaks/bins + binarization/TF-IDF/coverage bias correction, (3) dimensionality reduction, and (4) community detection-based clustering. However, in exploring the best combination of modules to build such a method, it is important to consider the balance between clustering performance, running time, and memory requirements. Such practical considerations are key to enabling the analysis of large datasets.</p><p id="Par86">Taken together, our manuscript provides a framework for evaluating and benchmarking new and existing methodologies as well as provides important guidelines for the analysis of scATAC-seq data. Importantly, we provide more than 100 well-organized and documented Jupyter notebooks to illustrate and reproduce all the analyses performed in this benchmarking work.

It then computes the co-accessibility scores between sites using Graphical Lasso. To get the gene activity scores, it selects sites that are proximal to gene TSS or distal sites linked to them and weight them by their co-accessibility.

Bins that overlap ENCODE-defined blacklist regions are filtered out, and the top 20,000 most commonly used bins are retained. Then, the bins-by-cells binary matrix is normalized and rescaled using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) transformation. Next, singular value decomposition (SVD) is performed to generate a PCs-by-cells LSI score matrix, which is used to group cells by hierarchical clustering into different clades. Within each clade, peak calling is performed on the aggregated scATAC-seq profiles, and identified peaks are combined into a new peaks-by-cells binary matrix.

For both hierarchical clustering and k-means, we set the number of clusters to the number of unique FACS-sorted labels or known tissues. In the 10X PBMCs scATAC-seq dataset, which lacks the FACS-sorted labels, we instead set the number of clusters to 8 since this is the expected number of populations based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For the Louvain algorithm, we set the size of local neighborhood to 15 for all the datasets. Since Louvain method requires &#x0201c;resolution&#x0201d; instead of the number of clusters and different number of clusters will affect the clustering evaluation, to make the comparison fair, we use the binary search algorithm on the &#x0201c;resolution&#x0201d; (ranging from 0.0 to 3.0) to find the same number of clusters as the other two clustering methods. If the precise number of clusters did not match the desired value, the &#x0201c;resolution&#x0201d; value inducing the closest number of clusters to the desired value was used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Metrics for evaluating clustering results</title><p id="Par110">To evaluate clustering solutions for datasets with a known ground truth (i.e., for each cell, we have a label that indicated the cell type), we used three well-established metrics: adjusted Rand index (ARI), mutual information, and homogeneity. Briefly, for the ARI, first, the Rand index (RI) is defined as a similarity measure between two clusters considering all pairs of samples assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and true clustering. Then, the raw RI score is adjusted for chance in the ARI score as described in the following formula:</p><p id="Par111">

We reasoned that a good clustering solution should contain clusters that are enriched for accessibility of different marker genes, and each marker gene should be highly accessible in only one or a few clusters. First, to quantify the accessibility of each gene in each cell, we used the Gene Scoring approach described above. Briefly, the accessibility at each TSS is the distance-weighted sum of reads within or near the region. Second, to quantify the enrichment of each gene in each cluster of cells, we computed the mean of the accessibility values in all cells for each cluster. Third, based on the vector of mean accessibility values (one per cluster), we computed the Gini index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] for each marker gene. The Gini index measures how imbalanced the accessibility of a gene is across clusters. This score is bound by [0,1] where 1 means total imbalance (i.e., a gene is accessible in one cluster only) and 0 means no enrichment. This score has been previously used on scRNA-seq to perform clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. As a control, we also calculated the Gini index for a set of annotated housekeeping genes reported in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://m.tau.ac.il/~elieis/HKG/HK_genes.txt">https://m.tau.ac.il/~elieis/HKG/HK_genes.txt</ext-link>. Housekeeping genes should show minimal specificity for any given cluster since, by definition, they are highly expressed in all cells. Based on the set of Gini index values for marker and housekeeping genes, we calculated several metrics: (i) the mean Gini index for the two groups, (ii) the difference in means to assess the average residual specificity that a clustering solution has with respect to marker genes (this is our proposed RAGI metric), and (iii) the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and its <italic>p</italic> value comparing the two groups of Gini indices for marker and housekeeping genes. We sorted the methods based on the descending order of the differences in means (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S13); a positive value indicates that the marker genes on average separate the clusters better than uninformative housekeeping genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Rare cell type-specific peak analysis</title><p id="Par117">FACS-sorted bulk ATAC-seq data was downloaded and processed from a previously described resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For each simulation, we created a randomly sampled set of 200 million unique (PCR-deduplicated) reads, which roughly represents a complexity similar to recommendations from the 10X Chromium scATAC-seq solution. Cell type-specific peaks were defined using the full dataset for each of the three cell types. Peaks were called using macs2 callpeak with custom parameters as in the ENCODE pipeline, i.e., &#x0201c;<italic>--nomodel --shift - 100 --extsize 200</italic>&#x0201d; to account for Tn5 insertions rather than read abundance when inferring peaks.

For each minor population (B cell, CD4+ T cell, monocyte) and each prevalence (1, 5, 10, 20, 30%), each simulation was repeated 5 times for a total of 75 simulations. Reads from the other two (major) populations were sampled equivalently to make up the synthetic mixture for comparison.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec49"><p>
