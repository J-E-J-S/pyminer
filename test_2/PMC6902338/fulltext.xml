Despite that many studies and tools are aimed at reconstructing NGS data into complete de novo genomes, this goal is challenging to achieve because of an intrinsic limitation of NGS data, i.e., read lengths are shorter than most of the repetitive sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The existence of repeats makes it challenging to reconstruct a complete genome instead of generating lots of contiguous sequences (contigs) even when the sequencing coverage is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, attention has focused on the so-called genomic scaffolding procedure, which aims at reducing the number of contigs by using fragments of moderate lengths whose ends are sequenced (double-barreled data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, long repetitive sequences still limit genomic assembly.</p><p id="Par10">As the development of third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies, it sheds light on different alternatives to solve genome assembly problems by offering very long reads. For example, the single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology of Pacific Biosciences&#x000ae; (PacBio) delivers read lengths of up to 50 kbp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and the nanopore sequencing technology of Oxford Nanopore Technologies&#x000ae; (Nanopore) yields read lengths that are greater than 800 kbp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Also, the Hi-C data provides much longer-range linking information than other technologies (such as mate pairs, optical maps, linked reads) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. With the TGS long reads and the Hi-C data on de novo assembly, it is possible to reconstruct genome into complete chromosome arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, these long reads suffer from high sequencing error rates, which necessitate high coverage during the de novo assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Also, TGS technologies have a higher cost per base than NGS methods, and the Hi-C data would produce small inversions within the scaffolds when the draft assemblies are not with good quality and contiguity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. On a large-scale assembly project (such as the ruminant project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]), a more reasonable and cost-effective way is to improve the contiguity of draft assemblies constructed by NGS data with low coverage long reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The process of genome assembly typically divides into two major steps. The first step is to piece-by-piece overlap reads into contigs. This step commonly performs using <italic>de Bruijn</italic> or overlap graphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The second step is to assemble scaffolds that consist of ordered the oriented contigs with estimated distances between them. Scaffolding, which was first introduced by Huson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], is a critical part of the genome assembly process, especially for NGS data. Scaffolding is an active research area because of NP-hard complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. By using paired-end and/or mate-pair reads, a number of standalone scaffolders, e.g., Bambus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], MIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Opera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], SCARPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], SOPRA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], SSPACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], BESST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and BOSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] have been developed. A recent comprehensive evaluation showed that scaffolding remains computationally intractable and requires larger insert-size and higher quality pair read libraries than what is presently available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As TGS technologies are likely to offer longer reads than the lengths of the most common repeats, these technologies are capable of drastically reducing and overcoming the complexity caused by repeats. Considering the pros and cons of NGS and TGS data, a hybrid assembly approach that assembles draft genomes using TGS data was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The core strategy of this approach is: 1) long reads are mapped onto the contigs using a long-read mapper (e.g., BLASR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or minimap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]); 2) alignment information is examined, and long reads that span more than one contig are identified and their linking relationship is stored in a data structure; 3) the last step is to clean up the structure by removing redundant and error-prone links, calculate distances between contigs, and build scaffolds using linking information.</p><p id="Par12">AHA was the first standalone scaffolder basing on the hybrid-assembly strategy, and this algorithm was part of the SMRT analysis software suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As AHA is designed for small genomes and has limitations on the input data, it is not suitable for large genomes. To ensure that scaffolds are as contiguous as possible, AHA performs six iterations by default, thus increasing the run time. For comparison, SSPACE-LongRead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] produces final scaffolds in a single iteration and, therefore, has a significantly shorter run time than AHA. Nevertheless, SSPACE-LongRead has somewhat lower assembly accuracy than AHA. Despite being designed for eukaryotic genomes, the run time of SSPACE-LongRead is unpractical on large genomes. LINKS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] opens a new door to building linking information between contigs. The algorithm uses the long interval nucleotide K-mer without computational alignment and a reads-correction step. The memory usage of LINKS is noteworthy. OPERA-LG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] provides an exact algorithm for large and repeat-rich genomes. It requires significant mate-pair information to constrain the scaffold graph and yield an optimised result. OPERA-LG is not directly designed for TGS data. To construct scaffold edges and link contigs into scaffolds, OPERA-LG needs to simulate and group mate-pair relationship information from long reads. Recently, scaffolding algorithms, such as SMIS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/smis">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/smis</ext-link>), npScarf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], DBG2OLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and Unicycler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], incorporate the hybrid-assembly strategy. However, these tools have not been thoroughly assessed for different genome sizes, especially large genomes.</p><p id="Par13">Here we present a Long Reads Scaffolder (LRScaf) that improves draft genomes using TGS data. The input to LRScaf is given by a set of contigs and their alignments over PacBio or Nanopore long reads. We compare our algorithm with state-of-the-art tools on datasets for seven species (i.e., <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, <italic>Solanum pennellii</italic>, <italic>Zea mays</italic>, and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>). All the tested methods improve the contiguity of pre-assembled genomes. LRScaf yields the best assembly metrics and contiguity for the pre-assembled genomes on <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>S. pennellii</italic>, <italic>Z. mays</italic>, and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>. More importantly, our method consistently returns high-quality scaffolds and has the shortest run time. LRScaf significantly improves the contiguity of human draft assemblies, increasing the NGA50 value of CHM1 from 127.1 kbp to 9.4 Mbp with 20-fold coverage PacBio dataset and the NGA50 value of NA12878 from 115.3 kbp to 12.9 Mbp with 35-fold coverage Nanopore dataset. Thus, we show that LRScaf is a promising tool for improving draft assemblies in a computationally cost-effective way.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Implementation</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental data</title><p id="Par14">The present study performs on two small genomes (<italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), three medium genomes (<italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>O. sativa</italic>, and <italic>S. pennellii</italic>), and two large genomes (<italic>Z. mays</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>). All the tested data of the seven species are collected from published datasets except the Illumina dataset of <italic>O. sativa,</italic> which is sequenced in this study (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For the PacBio long reads datasets, we select the first 20-fold coverage of each PacBio dataset to assess all the scaffolders comprehensively. To test all the scaffolders&#x02019; performances on the lower depths, we use three different coverages, i.e., 1, 5, and 10 -fold for the two small genomes and 1, 5, and 15 -fold for <italic>H. sapiens</italic> (NA12878). To assess scaffolder performances for different median read lengths, we use three different medians (8, 18, and 26 kbp) of 10-fold coverage on the <italic>E. coli</italic> PacBio datasets. The coverage of the Nanopore long reads datasets is not too high, and, therefore, we use all of the long reads data from these datasets to assess scaffolder performances.

The high error rate is a severe disadvantage of TGS long reads. Thus, a significant fraction of the alignments is incorrect and needs to be filtered out. We develop a validation model to validate each alignment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The model partitions each long read into three regions (R1, R2, and R3) that are separated by two points (P1 and P2).

We also define the distal length of a contig to the start or end alignment loci as the over-hang length of the contig. Taking both the alignment region and the over-hang length into account, the valid alignment satisfies: 1) (S in R1, E in R1) with the right over-hang length not exceeding the constraints; 2) (S in R1, E in R2) with the right over-hang length not exceeding the constraints; 3) (S in R2, E in R2) with the over-hang length of two ends not exceeding the constraints; 4) (S in R2, E in R3) with the left over-hang length not exceeding the constraints; 5) (S in R3, E in R3) with the left over-hang length not exceeding the constraints. An alignment is filtered out if a long read is entirely covered by a contig (S in R1, E in R3), i.e., the contig contains the long read. After this procedure, the remaining alignments are considered to be valid for the scaffolding procedure.

Their ID annotates the ends of each contig with a forward strand (+). Using this node concept, there are 4 types of edges in the graph, i.e., (+, +) joining the forward strands of both contigs, (+, &#x02212;) joining the forward strand of the first contig with the reverse strand of the second contig, (&#x02212;, +) joining the reverse strand of the first contig with the forward strand of the second contig, and (&#x02212;, &#x02212;) joining the reverse strands of both contigs.

There are, however, some complex regions that required addition manipulation. We refer to a contig as a divergent node if it links more than two nodes in the graph (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). LRScaf searches for unique nodes at the end of this complex region and steps through this region for as long as there are long reads that join two unique nodes. If a divergent node is reached, LRScaf stops travelling the graph in the forward direction and switches to the reverse direction. Similarly, the search along the reverse direction of the graph stops at the end of a linear stretch or a divergent node. The process is then repeated using an unvisited node as the starting node. The procedure ends after traversing all the unvisited and unique nodes in the graph, thus exposing all linear paths. Finally, the gap-size between contigs is calculated. If the gap-size value is negative, the contigs are merged into a combined contig, and if the value is positive, a gap is inserted between the contigs (a gap is represented by one or more undefined &#x02018;N&#x02019; nucleotides, depending on gap-size).

The parameter settings can be provided via the program&#x02019;s command line or through an XML configuration input file. In the file-related section, input parameters are required for the alignment file, draft assemblies, and output path. In the alignment-validation section, there are six mandatory parameters for the alignment-validation model. These are min_overlap_length, min_overlap_ratio, max_overhang_length, max_overhang_ratio, max_end_length, and max_end_ratio. Whereas loosening these parameters improves assembly contiguity, the number of misassemblies increases. In the performance-related section, there are 7 parameters, i.e., min_contig_length, identity, min_supported_links, repeat_mask and tip_length, iqr_time, and process. It will sometimes be necessary to change the values of these parameters based on data. If, for example, long-read coverage is low and assembly contiguity is the main priority, reducing the values of identity and min_supported_links could significantly improve the assembly contiguity. Besides, masking repeats could decrease the number of divergent nodes in the scaffolding graph and generate more contiguous scaffolds.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par22">We perform in-depth analysis on seven species (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), i.e., <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>O. sativa</italic>, <italic>S. pennellii</italic>, <italic>Z. mays</italic>, and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, to test and compare the performances of LRScaf with that of SMIS, npScarf, DBG2OLC, Unicycler, SSPACE-LongRead, LINKS, and OPERA-LG.

For the two small genomes, assembly contiguity obtained from SSPACE-LongRead, SMIS, Unicycler, and LRScaf are generally better than those obtained from LINKS, OPERA-LG, npScarf, and DBG2OLC (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Supplementary Note; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#x000a0;S1).

The BUSCO assessments for SSPACE-LongRead and LRScaf are 92.7 and 93.4%, respectively. For <italic>H. sapiens</italic> (CHM1), SMIS and SSPACE-LongRead are excluded in the comparisons because they exceed the one-month time limit, and OPERA-LG is excluded because of the lack of NGS data. LRScaf generates the NGA50 value and the longest sequence (9.4 Mbp and 45.0 Mbp, respectively). The assembly contiguity (NG50 and NGA50) is about two times contiguous than that of DBG2OLC. The BUSCO measurement for LRScaf is 94.0%. To summarise, LRScaf yields comparable or superior metrics when compared with other scaffolders on PacBio long reads.

Nevertheless, from a practical point of view, the run time limits software applications. As evident from our experiments, the run time and the memory usage for scaffolding procedures become significant concerns for large and complex genomes. LRScaf is the fastest scaffolder on the benchmarks. For the PacBio dataset of <italic>O. sativa</italic>, LRScaf reduces the CPU time more than 6700 times compared with SMIS. MaSuRCA-Hy produces the best assembly contiguity. However, its run time is 1600 times longer than LRScaf. For <italic>Z. mays</italic>, LRScaf is 20 times faster than SSPACE-LongRead. On the Nanopore dataset, LRScaf reduces the CPU time more than 4700 times compared with SMIS for <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and 380 times compared with MaSuRCA-Hy for <italic>S. pennellii</italic>. Our experiments show that the memory usage of LRScaf is practical even for large and complex genomes because the peak RAM usage remains below 30.0&#x02009;GB on the CHM1 PacBio dataset and 70.0&#x02009;GB on the NA12878 Nanopore dataset respectively.</p><p id="Par27">Reducing the number of misassemblies is important because misassemblies are likely to be misinterpreted as real genetic variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. For the PacBio dataset, LRScaf and SSPACE-LongRead yield the fewest number of misassemblies on <italic>O. sativa</italic> and <italic>Z. mays</italic>, respectively. For the Nanopore dataset, OPERA-LG has the best assembly accuracy on <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> and LRScaf yields the fewest number of misassemblies on <italic>S. pennellii</italic>. LRScaf yields a relatively low number of misassemblies in most of the studied cases. We have no record on the number of misassemblies on <italic>H. sapiens</italic> for the other scaffolders because all of them fail to scaffold the draft assemblies. In summary, LRScaf introduces a new strategy for keeping valid alignments and produces only a moderate number of misassemblies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par28">In this work, we present a novel algorithm&#x000a0;(LRScaf, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) for scaffolding draft assemblies using noisy TGS long reads and compare our algorithm with published methods. The majority of the draft assemblies constructed using NGS data are fragmented and influenced by repeats. To improve the contiguity of draft assemblies using TGS long reads, there are two strategies on the scaffolding step: 1) simulating mate-pair information (e.g., OPERA-LG and Fast-SG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]), and 2) using the full-length long reads information (e.g., SSPACE-LongRead and LRScaf). Both strategies could improve the contiguity of draft assemblies. The first strategy could build the scaffolding graph from either short or long reads and have sufficient and convenient linking information from a range of synthetic insert-size mate-pair libraries as well as for the NGS standalone scaffolder reuse. The run time for processing the synthetic linking information and the impact of base accuracy are significant concerns. For the second strategy, it could do the scaffolding step in a speedy and memory-efficient way. Considering only the linking information from long reads would neglect the linking information of paired reads library, whereas integrating paired reads information could improve assembly accuracy. We successfully use long reads to improve draft assemblies over different NGS de novo assemblers. Basing on assembly contiguity and accuracy, DISCOVAR and SOAPdenovo2 are the recommended NGS de novo assemblers for LRScaf.</p><p id="Par29">We propose a new strategy to filter out inaccurate alignments so that these false alignments do not propagate through the scaffolding process. For the assessments on PacBio and Nanopore long-read datasets covering seven organisms, our method shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art scaffolders. The primary benefits of LRScaf are significant reductions in run time and memory usage. These benefits are especially crucial for large and complex genomes. As studied genomes keep getting bigger and more complex, the run time and memory usage of scaffolding software become increasingly essential to biologists and bioinformaticians. Our method is designed to reduce run time and memory usage. Thus, LRScaf is computationally more efficient than other scaffolders. Identification of misassembled contigs is also essential because any misassembled sequences are propagated into the next step during biological analysis. Most state-of-the-art scaffolders lack functions for the identification of misassembled contigs. Besides, misassemblies might be introduced during the scaffolding procedure. Consequently, to limit the number of misassembled scaffolds, our method incorporates an effective validation algorithm to reduce the influence of false alignment.</p><p id="Par30">In the past decade, worldwide collaboration has led to several projects aiming at improving the understanding of species biology and evolution. Examples of such projects are the i5k [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], which provides the genomes of 5000 species of insects, and the Bird 10,000 Genomes (B10K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A substantial fraction of genomes with short contiguity prevent downstream analysis. Our result shows that TGS data is capable of effectively improving draft assemblies, and LRScaf is a valuable tool for cost-effectively improving these draft assemblies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Availability and requirements</title><p id="Par31">Project name: LRScaf.</p><p id="Par32">Project home page: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/shingocat/lrscaf">https://github.com/shingocat/lrscaf</ext-link></p><p id="Par33">Operating system(s): Platform independent.</p><p id="Par34">Programming language: Java.</p><p id="Par35">Other requirements: Java 1.8 or higher.</p><p id="Par36">License: GNU GPL.</p><p id="Par37">Any restrictions to use by non-academics: license needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
