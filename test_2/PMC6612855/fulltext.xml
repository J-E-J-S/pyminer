These interactions can be modeled using a network whose nodes represent microbial taxa and edges represent pairwise interactions. A microbial network is typically constructed from a sample-taxa count matrix that is obtained by sequencing multiple biological samples and identifying taxa counts. From large-scale microbiome studies, it is evident that microbial community compositions and interactions are impacted by environmental and/or host factors. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that a sample-taxa matrix generated as part of a large study involving multiple environmental or clinical parameters can be associated with more than one microbial network.

Microbial communities are also found in association with higher life forms, including plants and animals; for instance, trillions of microbes live in or on the human body (almost as many human cells as there are in the body) (<xref rid="btz370-B26" ref-type="bibr">Sender et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>) and ongoing research continues to reveal the important roles that many of these microbes play in human health (<xref rid="btz370-B14" ref-type="bibr">Huttenhower <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="btz370-B23" ref-type="bibr">Qin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Microbial communities are typically structured and composed of members of different species. The microbes in a community do not exist in isolation, but interact with each other and also compete for the available carbon and energy sources. These interactions, along with resource availability and environmental parameters (like temperature, pH and salinity) (<xref rid="btz370-B11" ref-type="bibr">Hibbing <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="btz370-B29" ref-type="bibr">Williamson and Yooseph, 2012</xref>), determine the taxonomic composition of the microbial community and the abundance levels of its constituents. Knowledge of these interactions is crucial for understanding the overall behavior of the microbial community, and can be used to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying microbe-associated disease progression and microbe-mediated processes (like biofilm formation).</p><p>The study of microbial communities has been greatly enabled with the advent of high-throughput next-generation DNA sequencing technologies (<xref rid="btz370-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bentley, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="btz370-B22" ref-type="bibr">Margulies <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="btz370-B24" ref-type="bibr">Quail <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The taxonomic composition of a microbial community can be obtained by sequencing the DNA extracted from a biological sample that has been collected from the environment of interest. This is achieved either using a targeted approach, involving the sequencing of a taxonomic marker gene [for instance, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, which is found in all bacteria (<xref rid="btz370-B30" ref-type="bibr">Woese and Fox, 1977</xref>)] or using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach (<xref rid="btz370-B27" ref-type="bibr">Venter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Both approaches generate taxa counts that are <italic>compositional</italic> in nature, and that enable the estimation of the <italic>relative</italic> abundances of the constituent members of the community.</p><p>Microbial interactions can be modeled using a weighted graph (or network), where each node in the graph represents a taxon (or taxonomic group) and an (undirected) edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding taxa interact with, or influence, each other. The edge weight captures the strength of the interaction, with its sign reflecting whether the interaction is positive or negative. This framework can be used to model a variety of microbial interactions, including competition and co-operation. While we do not consider it here, a directed graph can also be used to represent interactions, where the edge direction indicates the direction of influence (or causality).</p><p>Microbial networks are typically constructed from sample-taxa count matrices. A sample-taxa count matrix is generated by sequencing multiple biological samples (<italic>n</italic> samples) collected from the environment of interest and identifying the counts of the observed taxa (<italic>d</italic> taxa) in each sample.</p><p>As we discuss briefly below, microbial networks can be constructed using a variety of different approaches. To our knowledge, all of these methods assume that the sample-taxa matrix is associated with a <italic>single</italic> underlying stochastic process (i.e. there is one underlying network topology and set of edge weights). However, this need not always be the case. In this paper, we consider an important extension to the network inference problem, whereby we develop a mixture modeling framework for inferring <italic>K</italic> microbial networks when the observed sample-taxa matrix is associated with <italic>K</italic> underlying distributions. We are motivated by large-scale human-associated and other environmental microbial community projects that are now possible due to cost-effective sequencing. For instance, human gut microbiome studies now routinely analyze large cohorts of individuals and generate microbial community data from several hundreds (to even thousands) of samples. An important research question in this area involves the definition of a &#x02018;core&#x02019; microbiome associated with a particular host phenotype (<xref rid="btz370-B14" ref-type="bibr">Huttenhower <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="btz370-B23" ref-type="bibr">Qin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). It is well understood that the gut microbiome composition is greatly influenced by many factors including diet and age, and thus it is not unreasonable to expect the associated microbial network interactions to also be different when these factors vary (e.g. the gut microbial community interaction network in vegetarian hosts can be expected to be different compared to the network in non-vegetarian hosts). A similar situation also occurs in environmental studies where the microbial interactions are influenced greatly by the physical and chemical gradients of the environment. Often the collected metadata in these studies may not be comprehensive enough to discern these interactions in a supervised manner. Our proposed mixture framework offers a principled approach to identifying these multiple microbial interaction networks from a sample-taxa matrix.</p><p>Several methods have been proposed for constructing a <italic>single</italic> microbial network from an input sample-taxa matrix (<xref rid="btz370-B20" ref-type="bibr">Layeghifard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). One approach involves using pairwise correlations (Pearson or Spearman) between taxa to define the edge weights in the graph. However, the computation of these correlation networks directly from the observed count data can be misleading because of the compositional nature of these data (<xref rid="btz370-B10" ref-type="bibr">Gloor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, for a microbial network with <italic>d</italic> nodes, while there are <inline-formula id="IE1"><mml:math id="IM1"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> edge weights that need to be determined, the number of available samples <italic>n</italic> is often not large enough, with the result that the system of equations to determine all pairs of correlations is under-determined. This later issue is typically handled by assuming that the network is sparse [i.e. the number of edges is <italic>O</italic>(<italic>d</italic>)]. Methods based on latent variable modeling have been proposed to infer correlation networks (<xref rid="btz370-B7" ref-type="bibr">Fang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz370-B9" ref-type="bibr">Friedman and Alm, 2012</xref>). These methods use log-ratio transformations of the original count data (<xref rid="btz370-B1" ref-type="bibr">Aitchison, 1982</xref>) to deal with the compositional nature of these data and subsequently infer the correlation matrix (i.e. edge weights) under the assumption of sparsity. Microbial networks have also been constructed using a probabilistic graphical model framework (<xref rid="btz370-B15" ref-type="bibr">Jordan, 1999</xref>) that enables the modeling of conditional dependencies associated with the interactions. For instance, the assumption that the log-ratio transformed count data follow a Gaussian distribution, results in a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) framework. In this scenario, the graph structure represents the precision matrix (or inverse covariance matrix) of the underlying multivariate Gaussian distribution. This graph has the property that an edge exists between two nodes iff the corresponding entry in the precision matrix is non-zero. A zero entry in the precision matrix indicates conditional independence between the two corresponding random variables. When the graph is assumed to be sparse, the GGM inference problem can be solved using sparse precision matrix estimation algorithms (<xref rid="btz370-B8" ref-type="bibr">Friedman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This approach has been used to construct microbial networks from sample-taxa matrices (<xref rid="btz370-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kurtz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p>An alternate approach to constructing a microbial network, and that which we adopt in this paper, is to model the vector of observed taxa counts (in samples) using a multivariate distribution and to infer the parameters of this distribution from the observed data using a maximum likelihood framework. Any candidate multivariate distribution for this approach will have to be flexible enough to capture the underlying covariance structure to model the network interactions (i.e. allow for both positive and negative covariances); this rules out distributions like the multinomial or the Dirichlet-Multinomial, which are popular choices for modeling microbial count data in certain situations (<xref rid="btz370-B12" ref-type="bibr">Holmes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="btz370-B18" ref-type="bibr">La Rosa et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>), but which cannot capture both types of interactions. The Multivariate Poisson Log-Normal (MPLN) distribution (<xref rid="btz370-B2" ref-type="bibr">Aitchison and Ho, 1989</xref>) can be used for modeling multivariate count data and its covariance structure can capture both positive and negative interactions. This distribution was used recently (<xref rid="btz370-B5" ref-type="bibr">Biswas et al., 2015</xref>) to model counts in a sample-taxa matrix and infer an underlying microbial network using an assumption of sparsity.</p><p>In this paper, we consider the following computational inference problem: for a sample-taxa matrix <italic>X</italic> (containing <italic>absolute</italic> counts of taxa) that is generated by a mixture model consisting of <italic>K</italic> MPLN component distributions, estimate the mixing coefficients and the distribution parameters of the <italic>K</italic> components. We note that the precision matrices of the <italic>K</italic> components define the <italic>K</italic> different microbial networks. We formulate this inference problem using a maximum likelihood framework, and estimate the various parameters of the constructed likelihood function directly using a numerical optimization method based on the minorization&#x02013;maximization (MM) principle (<xref rid="btz370-B19" ref-type="bibr">Lange, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btz370-B31" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="btz370-B34" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Lange, 2010</xref>). We extend this formulation based on an <italic>l</italic><sub>1</sub>-penalty model and provide algorithms to infer <italic>K</italic> sparse networks. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms using both synthetic and real datasets. We also evaluate the performance of our method on compositional data obtained by subsampling from the true counts of the taxa. This evaluation models the real-world scenario, where the sample-taxa matrices that we have access to, contain only <italic>relative</italic> abundances of the observed taxa.</p></sec><sec><title>2 Materials and methods</title><p>Prior to describing our mixture modeling framework, we describe a single MPLN distribution.

We find that there is strong evidence for two underlying (and different) microbial networks (<italic>K</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 components) associated with this sample-taxa data. We assigned component membership to the samples based on their final weights <italic>w<sub>il</sub></italic> [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E10">Equation (10)</xref>]. This resulted in Component 1 containing 158 samples and Component 2 containing 37 samples. The average age of the individuals in Component 1 was 9&#x02009;years while that of individuals in Component 2 was 0.7&#x02009;years. Our reconstructed networks are consistent with the observation that infants have a different gut microbiome composition compared to older children and adults (<xref rid="btz370-B32" ref-type="bibr">Yooseph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The constructed networks include edges involving bacterial groups like <italic>Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia&#x02013;Shigella</italic> that are known to be key players in early gut microbiome development. Our method identifies both positive and negative interactions between pairs of taxa (red and green edges) for the chosen threshold of 0.3; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref> shows the graph structures for other selected threshold values.
