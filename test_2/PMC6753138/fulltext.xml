In principle, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a platform for detecting genetic interactions, but existing methods for identifying them from GWAS data tend to focus on testing individual locus pairs, which undermines statistical power. Importantly, a global genetic network mapped for a model eukaryotic organism revealed that genetic interactions often connect genes between compensatory functional modules in a highly coherent manner. Taking advantage of this expected structure, we developed a computational approach called BridGE that identifies pathways connected by genetic interactions from GWAS data. Applying BridGE broadly, we discover significant interactions in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, schizophrenia, hypertension, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Our novel approach provides a general framework for mapping complex genetic networks underlying human disease from genome-wide genotype data.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Genetic interactions may contribute to phenotypic traits but are challenging to decipher.

However, for most diseases, there remains a substantial disparity between the disease risk explained by the discovered loci and the estimated total heritable disease risk based on familial aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. While there are a number of possible explanations for this &#x0201c;missing heritability&#x0201d;, including many loci with small effects or rare variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, genetic interactions between loci are one potential culprit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Genetic interactions generally refer to a combination of two or more genes whose contribution to a phenotype cannot be completely explained by their independent effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. One example of an extreme genetic interaction is synthetic lethality where two mutations, neither of which is lethal on its own, combine to generate a lethal double mutant phenotype. Thus, genetic interactions may explain how relatively benign variation can combine to generate more extreme phenotypes, including complex human diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Several studies have reported genetic interactions between specific variants in various disease contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and scalable computational tools have been developed for searching for interactions amongst SNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, systematic discovery of statistically significant genetic interactions on a genome-scale remains a major challenge. For example, a theoretical analysis estimated that ~500,000 subjects would be needed to detect significant genetic interactions under reasonable assumptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, which remains beyond the cohort sizes available for a typical GWAS study or even the large majority of meta-GWAS studies.</p><p id="Par4">Genome-wide, reverse genetic screens in model organisms have produced rich insights into the prevalence and organization of genetic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Specifically, the mapping and analysis of the yeast genetic network revealed that genetic interactions are numerous and tend to cluster into highly organized network structures, connecting genes in two different but compensatory functional modules (e.g., pathways or protein complexes) as opposed to appearing as isolated instances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. For example, nonessential genes belonging to the same pathway often exhibit negative genetic interactions with the genes of a second nonessential pathway that impinges on the same essential function (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Owing to their functional redundancy, the two different pathways can compensate for the loss of the other, and thus, only simultaneous perturbation of both pathways (e.g., A* and Y*) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) results in an extreme loss of function phenotype, which could be associated with either increased or decreased disease risk. Importantly, the same phenotypic outcome could be achieved by several different combinations of genetic perturbations in both pathways (e.g., A-X, A-Z, B-X, B-Y, B-Z) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This model for the local topology of genetic networks, called the &#x0201c;between-pathway model&#x0201d; (BPM), has been widely observed in yeast genetic interaction networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Indeed, as many as ~70% of negative genetic interactions observed in yeast occur in BPM structures, indicating that genetic interactions are highly organized and this type of local clustering is the rule rather than the exception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition to BPMs, combinations of mutations in genes within the same pathway or protein complex also tend to exhibit a high frequency of genetic interaction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), a network structure referred to as a &#x0201c;within-pathway model&#x0201d; (WPM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Indeed, ~80% of essential protein complexes in yeast exhibit a significantly elevated frequency of within-pathway interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the context of human disease, a WPM may reflect an individual that inherits two variants in the same pathway, resulting in reduced flux or function of a particular pathway and an increase or decrease in disease risk.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Between-pathway and within-pathway model of genetic interactions. <bold>a</bold> Two distinct pathways, A&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;B&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;C and X&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Y&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Z converge to regulate the same essential function.

Although tests to identify genetic interactions between specific SNP or gene pairs are statistically under-powered, we may be able to detect genetic interactions by leveraging the fact that pairwise interactions between genome variants are likely to cluster into larger BPM and WPM network structures similar to those observed in the yeast global genetic network. Indeed, other studies exploited similar structural properties to derive genetic interaction networks from phenotypic variation in a yeast recombinant inbred population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we present a new method, called BridGE (Bridging Gene sets with Epistasis), that leverages the expected between- and within-pathway structure of genetic interactions to discover them based on human population genetic data. We present results from application of this method to seven different diseases, with significant interactions discovered in six of the seven, along with extensive simulation results establishing the utility of the approach. We note that the method proposed here is broadly similar to previous approaches that have used gene-set enrichment or GO enrichment analysis to interpret SNP sets arising from univariate or interaction analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> or aggregation tests for rare variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (see Methods). Other existing approaches have also successfully identified interactions by reducing the test space for SNP&#x02013;SNP pairs, either through knowledge or data-driven prioritization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (see Methods). However, to our knowledge, no existing method has been developed to systematically identify between-pathway genetic interaction structures based on human genetic data, which is the focus of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>A new method for discovery of genetic interactions from GWAS</title><p id="Par7">We developed a method called BridGE (Bridging Gene sets with Epistasis) to explicitly search for coherent sets of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions within GWAS cohorts that connect groups of genes corresponding to characterized pathways or functional modules. Specifically, although many pairs of loci do not have statistically significant interactions when considered individually, they can be collectively significant if an enrichment of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions is observed between two functionally related sets of genes&#x000a0;or within a functional coherent gene set (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Thus, we imposed prior knowledge of pathway membership and exploited structural and topological properties of genetic networks to gain statistical power to detect genetic interactions that occur between or within defined pathways in GWAS associated with diverse diseases. Our algorithm identifies BPM structures, where two distinct pathways are &#x0201c;bridged&#x0201d; by several SNP-level interactions that connect them, as well as WPM structures, where interactions densely connect SNPs linked to genes in the same pathway, and finally, pathways whose SNPs show increased interaction density relative to the rest of SNPs in the network, though not coherently as in a BPM (referred to as &#x0201c;PATH&#x0201d; structures).</p><p id="Par8">Our approach involves five main components, each of which is described briefly below (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>; see Methods): (I) Data processing; (II) construction of a SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network; (III) binarization of the SNP&#x02013;SNP network; (IV) scoring of BPMs and WPMs for enrichment of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions; (V) estimation of false discovery rate based on a hybrid permutation strategy. (I) For data processing, in addition to standard GWAS data processing procedures, BridGE controls for population substructure between the cases and controls to eliminate false discoveries due to population stratification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Also, in dataset pre-processing, the input set of SNPs is pruned down to a subset of SNPs that are less likely in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other to avoid discovery of spurious BPM/WPM structures due to LD. (II) Construction of a SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network: BridGE can use any one of four different disease models to compute a SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network: additive, recessive, dominant, or combined recessive and dominant. When run in the additive, recessive and dominant mode, BridGE tests all SNP pairs across the two pathways using the same disease model. In the combined recessive and dominant mode, BridGE integrates edges derived from multiple disease models, which allows for SNPs to interact in multiple ways as long as they still connect across the two pathways of interest. Each model encodes different assumptions and will result in a different, overall complementary, set of significant BPM/WPM structures at the end of the pipeline. The additive disease model was implemented as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, with SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction scores derived from likelihood ratio tests comparing models with and without an interaction term<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Interactions based on recessive and dominant disease models are estimated using a hypergeometric-based metric that directly tests for disease association for individuals that are either homozygous (recessive and dominant models) or heterozygous (dominant only) for the minor allele at two loci of interest, and compares the observed degree of association to the marginal effects of both loci. BridGE can be run in any of these disease model modes and also implements a combined dominant/recessive mode where interactions among SNP pairs are taken from the maximum (most significant) of the dominant and recessive models. (III) Binarization of the SNP&#x02013;SNP network: The SNP&#x02013;SNP network derived from a chosen disease model is thresholded by applying a lenient significance cutoff to all pairwise SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions to generate a low-confidence, high-coverage network that is expected to contain a large number of false positive interactions, but enables the assessment of significance of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions collectively at the pathway level. The binarization threshold is determined by a pilot run that evaluates the SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network at a range of cutoffs with a limited number of permutations to establish preliminary significance estimates (see Methods). (IV) Scoring of BPMs and WPMs for enrichment of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions: after SNP&#x02013;SNP network binarization, pathways are defined by curated functional standards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and these pathways (in the case of WPMs) and pairs of pathways (for BPMs) are tested for enrichment of SNP&#x02013;SNP pair interactions. The enrichment significance is measured by a permutation test (<italic>p</italic><sub>perm</sub>) derived from randomly shuffling of the SNP-pathway assignment (see Methods). In addition to discovering BPM and WPM structures, our approach also identifies individual pathways that have significantly elevated marginal density of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions even where the interaction partners do not necessarily have clear coherence in terms of pathways (PATH structures, see Methods). In this case, we are not identifying pathway&#x02013;pathway interactions but simply assessing whether a particular pathway is a highly connected hub and associated with numerous SNP-level interactions. (V) Estimation of false discovery rate based on a hybrid permutation strategy: finally, to correct for multiple hypothesis testing and assess the significance of the candidate BPM, WPM, or PATH interactions, BridGE uses sample permutation to establish an FDR. Specifically, FDR is estimated by measuring the average number of discovered BPMs/WPMs from the random sample labels that achieve&#x000a0;a higher significance level than the BPMs/WPMs reported from the real sample labels relative to the total number of discoveries (i.e., FDR ~&#x02009;average number of discoveries at greater significance in the random permutations/total number of discoveries in the real dataset). As the number of hypothesis tests performed for all possible pathways and all possible between-pathway combinations is substantially less than the number of tests for all possible SNP pairs (~10<sup>5</sup> as compared to ~10<sup>11</sup>), our power for discovering interactions relative to approaches that operate on individual SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions is greatly increased. These five steps enabled us to extract statistically significant pathway-level interactions that can be associated with either increased risk of disease when pairs of minor alleles linked to two pathways occur more frequently in the diseased population or, conversely, decreased risk of disease when pairs of minor alleles annotated to two pathways occur more frequently in the control population.

This may suggest that, in the case of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, genetic interactions may be more frequently associated with protective effects, or alternatively, that there is more heterogeneity across the population in genetic interactions leading to increased risk, which would limit our ability to discover such interactions. Several BPM interactions were highly relevant to the biology of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. In particular, the Fc&#x003b5;RI signaling pathway represented a hub in the pathway-level genetic interaction network (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Fc&#x003b5;RI is the high-affinity receptor for Immunoglobulin E and is the major controller of the allergic response and associated inflammation. In general, immune-related inflammation has been frequently associated with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, and several immuno-modulating therapies have been pursued, but it remains unclear whether this is a causal driver of the disease or is rather a result of the neurodegeneration associated with disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. There has been relatively little focus on the specific role of Fc&#x003b5;RI in Parkinson&#x02019;s, but recent observations support the relevance of this pathway to the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. For example, Bower et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> reported an association between the occurrence of allergic rhinitis and increased susceptibility to PD. Furthermore, reduction of IL-13, one of the cytokines activated by Fc&#x003b5;RI and a member of the Fc&#x003b5;RI signaling pathway, was shown to have a protective effect in mouse models of PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and galectin-3, which is known to modulate the Fc&#x003b5;RI immune response, was shown to promote microglia activation induced by &#x003b1;-synuclein, a cellular phenotype associated with PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. These observations indicate that a hyperactive allergic response may predispose individuals to PD, and suggest that protective interactions discovered by our BridGE method may result from variants that subtly reduce the activity of this pathway.</p><p id="Par12">Aberrant events in the Golgi and related transport processes have also been known to play an important role in the pathology of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. For example, &#x003b1;-synuclein expression has been shown to interfere with ER-to-Golgi vesicular trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and the overexpression of Rab1, GTPase that regulates tethering and docking of the transport vesicle with the Golgi, was shown to protect against &#x003b1;-synuclein-induced dopaminergic neuron loss in an animal model of PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. BridGE discovered 5 distinct between- or within-pathway interactions involving the Golgi-associated vesicle biogenesis gene set, including a high confidence interaction with the Fc&#x003b5;RI signaling pathway (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Our result suggests that beyond this known interaction, there are many other combinations of common variants that affect vesicle trafficking involved in genetic interactions associated with risk of PD. BridGE also identified three protective interactions involving the IL-12 and STAT4 signaling pathway, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has a major role in regulating both the innate and adaptive immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

For the eight BPMs that were validated in the PD-NGRC cohort, five of them exhibited significant overlap in their supporting SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions, and collectively, the set of eight replicated BPMs were strongly shifted toward higher than expected SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction overlap (see Methods) (one-tailed rank-sum test <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, see Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">6</xref> for a list of SNP&#x02013;SNP pairs in common across cohorts). However, despite statistically significant overlap among SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions identified in replicated BPMs, the extent of the observed overlap in terms of fraction of pairs was relatively low for most cases, with all of them exhibiting an overlap coefficient of less than 0.15 (see Methods) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Thus, the same pathway&#x02013;pathway interaction may be supported by different sets of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions in different populations, or alternatively, this may reflect that the power for reliably pinpointing specific locus pairs is limited.

To fully explore the limits of our approach, we carried out a simulation study to estimate the statistical power afforded by the BridGE method with respect to sample size, interaction effect size, minor allele frequency, and pathway size, all of which should affect the sensitivity of detection of pathway-level genetic interactions.</p><p id="Par22">We focused our power analysis on the detection of BPMs, which comprise most of our discoveries. Briefly, our simulations involved two components: one in which the discovery rate of individual SNP&#x02013;SNP pairs was evaluated using a simulated population cohort, and another component that simulated the detection rate of BPM interaction structures across a range of sizes given the corresponding level of false positives in the SNP-level network as determined by the first component. More specifically, for the first component of these simulations, we used GWAsimulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> to generate synthetic GWAS datasets with 100 embedded SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction pairs under different controlled scenarios representing various combinations of different sample size, interaction effect size, and minor allele frequency. Then, we measured the discovery rate of the embedded SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions. This provides a direct measure of the sensitivity and specificity of the SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction-level measure that forms the basis of the pathway-level statistics. The statistics on sensitivity and specificity of SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction detection from this component of our simulations were then used to guide a second set of simulations in which we assessed the sensitivity of BridGE in detecting BPMs with different levels of noise in the SNP&#x02013;SNP level network. We generated a synthetic SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network matching the degree distribution of the network derived from one of the real datasets (PD-NIA, dominant&#x02013;dominant model). Then, a set of non-overlapping BPMs among synthetic pathways of different sizes were embedded into this network, and BridGE was run to measure the rate of detection for each scenario (see Methods for more details on this simulation procedure).</p><p id="Par23">For each parameter setting, we measured the minimum cohort size required to detect a pathway-level interaction with the corresponding properties at a fixed FDR (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.25) (i.e., controlling the Type I error rate). Indeed, we found that each of the evaluated parameters (sample size, interaction effect size, minor allele frequency, and pathway size) affected the power of our approach (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). As expected, the sensitivity of our method increases with increasing pathway size, which is a key motivation for the approach. For example, our power analysis indicated that a minimum cohort size of 5000 individuals (2500 cases, 2500 controls) is required to detect a 25&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;25 BPM (i.e., two interacting pathways with 25 SNPs mapping to each pathway) that confers a 2&#x000d7; increase in risk with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.05 (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;25%) while a 300&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;300 BPM with the same effect size would require only 1000 individuals (500 cases, 500 controls) for detection at the same level of significance (simulation results for more stringent FDR cutoffs). As expected, the sensitivity of the approach also increases for interactions involving SNPs with higher MAF. For example, the same 25&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;25 BPM involving variants at MAF of 0.15 conferring 2&#x000d7; increase in risk can be detected from cohorts as small as 2000 individuals (1000 cases, 1000 controls), and a 300&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;300 BPM with these characteristics could be detected from a cohort as small as 500 individuals (250 cases, 250 controls). A key parameter affecting these power estimates is the assumed biological density of interactions, which we define as the fraction of SNP&#x02013;SNP pairs crossing two pathways of interest that actually have a functional impact on the disease phenotype relative to all possible SNP&#x02013;SNP pairs. We assumed a density of 5% for the power analysis reported here (analysis based on 2.5 and 10% are included in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), meaning that the fraction of SNP pairs that have the potential to jointly influence the phenotype comprise only a small minority of all possible SNP pairs. In practice, we anticipate that this frequency varies substantially across different pathways, depending on the frequency of functionally deleterious SNPs that are present in the population for each pathway. A higher density of functionally deleterious SNPs will result in higher sensitivity of our approach and vice versa, a lower density of functionally deleterious SNP combinations can substantially reduce the sensitivity of our approach (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Notably, while statistical power increases with pathway size (i.e., number of SNPs mapping to each pathway), this is only true under the assumption that the SNPs (and the corresponding genes) actually contribute in a functionally coherent manner to the particular pathway or functional module. On the real disease cohorts, we discovered interactions for a large range of pathway sizes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), suggesting there are even relatively small functional modules (e.g., &#x0003c;20 associated SNPs) that have sufficiently strong interaction effects to be detected. In general, these power analyses confirm that our approach is sufficiently powered to discover pathway-level genetic interactions at moderate effect size (~2&#x000d7; increased/decreased risk) for relatively small cohorts (~500 or more individuals), which suggests it could be broadly applied to discover interactions in hundreds of existing GWAS cohorts that have been previously analyzed using only univariate approaches.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Simulation-based power analysis.

Genetic interactions identified from eleven GWAS cohorts representing six different diseases confirmed that structures prevalent in genetic networks of model organisms are indeed apparent in human disease populations and that these structures can be leveraged to discover significant genetic interactions that occur either between or within biological pathways or functional modules. Genetic interactions discovered for these six diseases have the potential to contribute substantially to our understanding of their genetic basis. For example, to date, there have been ~85 singly associated loci (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02013;7</sup>) and one genetic interaction (between <italic>FGF20</italic> and <italic>MAOB</italic>) reported for Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Here, we discovered 23 novel pathway-level genetic interactions, emphasizing the potential of our approach to expand our knowledge of the contribution of genetic variation associated with diseases such as PD. Indeed, many of the pathways discovered by our approach have not been previously implicated in these diseases. For example, the median percentage of BridGE-identified pathways for which there was at least one linked SNP reported in dbGaP across the six diseases was 22% (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM24" ref-type="media">20</xref>), indicating that the large majority of our discoveries represent novel insights that could not be made using standard single-locus approaches.</p><p id="Par25">There are several ways the BridGE method could be expanded and improved upon to better detect genetic interactions. First, our approach currently depends on literature-curated collections of biological pathways as a major input. The potential of our method to detect genetic interactions within or between well-defined pathways and functional modules could be substantially improved as more complete curated or data-derived functional standards are developed and integrated with the approach, which will be a focus of future work. Second, to avoid spurious network structures related to SNPs that map to genes located in close physical proximity or LD, we sampled a conservatively sized subset of tag SNPs to run our analysis for each dataset. This conservative approach has undoubtedly missed functional variants that may contribute to disease risk. More sophisticated approaches for retaining a larger set of tag SNPs while still controlling for LD structure could improve the sensitivity of our method. Finally, we emphasize that our study focuses exclusively on detecting pathway level genetic interactions between common variants assayed by typical GWAS. Continued development to examine the contribution of rare variants or interactions between rare variants and other loci, or to leverage the full set of variants identified through whole-genome or exome sequencing represent logical extensions of the BridGE approach.</p><p id="Par26">Developing mechanistic or clinically actionable disease insights based on the genetic interactions we have discovered will require additional strategies that build on pathway-level discoveries to generate more targeted hypotheses, followed by functional studies in disease models. One potential strategy to generate more targeted hypotheses involves leveraging an approach like BridGE to find pathways with robust disease-associated genetic interactions followed by a more targeted search for individual SNP&#x02013;SNP or gene&#x02013;gene pairs within these pathways that explain these structures. Our analysis of the Parkinson&#x02019;s cohort indicated that there is indeed significant overlap among the strongest SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions underlying replicated pathway level interactions, supporting the potential utility of this hierarchical approach.</p><p id="Par27">The extent to which genetic interactions contribute to the genetic basis of human disease has been the subject of recent debate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. This debate is in part fueled by differences in language among geneticists that regularly find physiological epistasis between specific alleles and statistical geneticists who measure the non-additive component of genetic variance in a population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. The target of our method is to discover disease-relevant physiological epistasis between sets of specific alleles in biological pathways based on population genetic data. Robust estimates of the additional heritability explained by pathway level genetic interactions discovered by our method will be a focus of future work, but we anticipate these genetic interactions represent just one of many contributions to heritability. Even in cases where the contribution to disease heritability is modest, genetic interactions define genetically distinct disease subtypes and point toward new insights about disease mechanism that can seed the search for new, targeted therapies. Also, recent studies suggest that accurately predicting the phenotypes of individuals from genotypes can depend critically on understanding interactions between genetic loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>, and thus, progress in personalized genome interpretation and medicine depends on our understanding of how specific alleles interact to cause phenotypes. Our work establishes a new paradigm for approaching this problem and provides a systematic method for detecting genetic interactions that can be applied to existing population genetic data for a variety of human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Brief summary of existing methods</title><p id="Par28">Although efficient and scalable computational tools have been developed for searching for interactions among genome-wide SNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, detecting them with statistical significance remains a major challenge.</p><p id="Par29">There are previous methods that have approached this problem, although from different perspectives than the method proposed here.

There are two key differences between these approaches and the method we propose. First, traditional approaches for GSEA start from univariate statistics of genes or SNPs, while our approach is built on interactions between pairs of SNPs that could have little or no single-locus association with a disease phenotype. Second, approaches for GSEA target the enrichment of single gene/SNP associations in each individual pathway while our approach explores the enrichment of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions crossing each pair of pathways (between-pathway model or BPMs).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Gene-set enrichment-based approaches applied to SNP-level summary statistics from interactions: The gene-set enrichment approach has also been applied beyond loci derived from univariate analysis. Another class of methods first measure genetic interactions based on pairwise SNP analysis, derive summary statistics at the individual SNP level based on specific interaction properties, and follow this with GSEA using pathway-associated SNP (or gene) interaction-based scores. For example, one such approach was recently applied to a bipolar study and a sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. In this study, whole-genome SNPs were first filtered based on their ECML scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup> and only the top 1000 SNPs with the strongest main effects and gene&#x02013;gene interactions were retained for studying SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions. Then, a SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network was constructed using a logistic regression model, and SNPs were ranked based on their network centrality in this network. Finally, candidate pathways were evaluated using a gene-set enrichment analysis based on pathway members&#x02019; rankings. A similar GO enrichment approach was applied to the sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, but SNP interaction strength was first estimated using a multiple dimension reduction (MDR) model and then summarized at a gene level&#x000a0;by enrichment analysis. GO annotation enrichment approaches were then applied to these gene-level scores. Again, these studies have not introduced the key concept that motivates our method: that genetic interactions connect coherently across pairs of distinct pathways.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Methods that use pathways as a prior to study SNP or gene level interactions to reduce the number of hypothesis tests: Another strategy implemented by other existing methods to address the multiple hypothesis testing challenge presented by pairwise SNP analysis is to reduce the number of hypothesis tests, based on a variety of different criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. These methods typically employ a filtering step, either data-driven<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup> or knowledge-driven<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>, before applying statistical analysis of interactions. Other illustrative examples of this class of approaches are from a recent autism spectrum disorder study where all possible SNPs were tested for interactions with the Ras/MAPK pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>, and a melanoma risk study where SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions were studied within the five pathways that are significant based on the traditional individual SNP based-GSEA analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. Most studies implementing this approach investigate interactions among a small set of genetic variants (genes or SNPs) that either statistically demonstrate evidence for individual association with the disease phenotype or are known to be relevant to the disease based on prior knowledge. Hence, systematic detection of genetic interactions among novel genes, or genes that show no marginal association will not be detected by these approaches.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Regression methods for pathway-based GWAS studies. A few regression approaches have been previously developed to leverage pathway information to model the relationship between&#x000a0;pathway SNPs and disease phenotypes with or without considering genetic interactions, including GRASS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>, PBA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>, and EBLasso<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>. These methods typically build a regression model using genetic variants (SNPs or pairwise SNPs when considering genetic interaction) from each pathway and use ridge or lasso methods to select a subset of variants. Then, a traditional gene-set enrichment analysis or logistic regression analysis is applied on the chosen genetic variants. Such methods are conceptually different from our proposed method because they do not explicitly search for genetic interactions forming coherent within-pathway or between-pathway structures, which is key foundation of our approach. Furthermore, the methods cited above do not provide evidence for replication of the reported pathway discoveries.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par35">In summary, existing approaches are related to the proposed approach in the general sense that they leverage existing knowledge of pathways or other sets of functionally related sets of genes to either perform enrichment on univariate effects or interaction-based SNP summary statistics (e.g., interaction degree), or simply use pathways as a prior to reduce the number of SNP pairs tested for interactions. To our knowledge, no existing methods explicitly test for higher-level interactions connecting within or between multiple pathways and are sufficiently powered to perform this systematically across comprehensive pathway databases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>GWAS datasets</title><p id="Par36">Twelve GWAS datasets, representing 13 different cohorts covering seven diseases, were used in this paper: Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD-NIA: phs000089.v3.p2, PD-NGRC: phs000196.v1.p1), breast cancer (BC-CGEMS-EUR, BC-MCS-JPN and BC-MCS-LTN: phs000517.v3.p1), schizophrenia (SCHZ-GAIN: phs000021.v3.p2; SCHZ-CATIE: CATIE study), hypertension (HT-eMERGE: phs000297.v1.p1; HT-WTCCC: cases are from EGAD00000000006, controls are from EGAD00000000001 and EGAD00000000002), prostate cancer (ProC-CGEMS: phs000207.v1.p1; ProC-BPC3: phs000812.v1.p1), pancreatic Cancer (.PanC-PanScan: phs000206.v3.p2) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D-WTCCC: cases are from EGAD00000000009, controls are from EGAD00000000001 and EGAD00000000002).

On the basis of the MDS plot, we removed samples that were not tightly clustered with the corresponding ancestry groups in the 1000 Genomes data.

A SNP was mapped to all genes that overlap with a &#x000b1;50&#x02009;kb window centered at the SNP, and then mapped to pathways to which the corresponding gene(s) were annotated. For the purposes of computing pathway-level statistics, a SNP was only associated once with each pathway, even if it mapped to multiple genes in the pathway.</p><p id="Par44">To avoid the discovery of trivial bipartite structures, SNPs in LD need to be removed before between or within-pathway enrichment of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions is conducted. Two general approaches can be pursued towards this goal: (1) removing SNPs in LD before calculating pairwise SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions; and (2) removing structures that emerge as a result of SNPs in LD after calculating pairwise SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions.</p><p id="Par45">The first alternative is more likely to miss informative SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions than the second because it only considers a subset of all SNPs, but is more computationally efficient and scalable. It is worth noting that a biclustering algorithm pursuing the second approach was designed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> to condense a yeast SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network into an LD-LD network. The algorithm described in that work took the SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction matrix as input and searched for sets of consecutive SNPs that had a statistically significant number of across-set SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions based on a hypergeometric test. The algorithm was applied on a yeast SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network (originally constructed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>) with 1977 SNPs, where the LD effect was assumed to be localized to less than 60 SNPs for computational reasons. We attempted to apply this algorithm to the human genotype datasets used in this paper and observed that the algorithm could handle about 1500 SNPs with a threshold of &#x003c3; below 60, but not beyond. For example, on a dataset with 2000 SNPs, the program did not finish in two days with <italic>&#x003c3;</italic> =&#x02009;100. Given issues with scalability of this approach, we adopted the first alternative, which is to select a subset of SNPs that are not in LD.</p><p id="Par46">To accomplish this, we used a procedure in PLINK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup> to select a subset of SNPs that are less likely in LD from each GWAS dataset, specifically &#x0201c;-indep-pairwise 50 5 0.1&#x0201d;. With this procedure, PLINK searches each window of 50 SNPs with a sliding step of 5 SNPs, and selects a subset of SNPs with pairwise <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> below 0.1 within each sliding window. After this procedure, ~15,000&#x02013;20,000 SNPs were left in each dataset, and the highest <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> between any pair of SNPs within any window of 1&#x02009;Mb is lower than the commonly used threshold for controlling LD (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup>, demonstrating that the LD was effectively controlled. Note that by using a stringent <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> threshold of 0.1, we are undoubtedly ignoring many informative SNPs. However, we chose this conservative approach to minimize the chance that spurious WPMs and&#x000a0;BPMs resulted from remaining LD structure. Future work that explores less conservative approaches to handling SNPs in LD would be worthwhile.</p><p id="Par47">For diseases that we tested for replication of discovered interactions on independent cohorts of the same ancestry, to make the discovery and replication analysis consistent for these instances, cohorts were first combined and then processed using the PLINK procedures described above to select the subset of SNPs on which the analysis was run. After selection of SNPs, population stratification and discovery of interactions was then performed independently. We followed this procedure for three of the diseases analyzed, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, schizophrenia, and breast cancer. For prostate cancer, our access to ProC-CGEMS and ProC-BPC3 was gained at different times, so SNPs used in ProC-BPC3 were selected based on the CGEMS cohort.

Our method implements multiple disease models, which affect how interactions are estimated at the SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction level. A minor allele (m) at each locus could be additive, dominant or recessive in the context of different diseases. For the additive model, we used the standard logistic regression-based model implemented in CASSI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup> to quantify the interaction between two SNPs coded as follows, mm&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, Mm&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, MM&#x02009;=&#x02009;0. In this model, the goodness-of-fit was compared between a standard logistic regression model with an interaction term between the two loci of interest and a standard logistic regression without an interaction term, and the significance of the interaction was measured by a likelihood ratio test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. We refer to this type of SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction as an additive&#x02013;additive (AA) model-based interaction. In the dominant model, a SNP is encoded as mm&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, Mm&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, MM&#x02009;=&#x02009;0. In the recessive model, a SNP is encoded as mm&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, Mm&#x02009;=&#x02009;0, MM&#x02009;=&#x02009;0. Because the minor allele could have recessive (R) or dominant (D) contribution to disease at two different loci comprising an interaction, four types of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions were examined: recessive&#x02013;recessive (RR), dominant&#x02013;dominant (DD), recessive&#x02013;dominant (RD), and dominant&#x02013;recessive (DR) model-based interaction for each pair of SNPs. The interactions under these four models can also be estimated by a logistic regression-based model similar to the AA case except with the appropriate encoding of the SNP genotypes. Alternatively, the RR, DD, DR, and RD interactions can be estimated by explicit statistical tests (e.g., hypergeometric tests) of the association between a specific genotype combination of two SNPs and a disease of interest, where this association is compared to the association between each of the individual SNPs and the disease (marginal effect). Interactions estimated by logistic regression-based models directly capture non-additive effects between two SNPs considering different combinations of SNP genotypes. In contrast, interactions estimated by explicit statistical tests have the flexibility of specifically testing certain combinations of genotypes for association with the phenotype. We explored alternative approaches both in representing different disease models and in the estimation of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions, and found that RR, DD, DR, and RD interactions estimated by explicit statistical tests more likely led to the discovery of significant BPMs/WPMs in the context of our BridGE approach. The measure we developed based on explicit statistical tests, called hygeSSI, is described in detail below.

All of these approaches quantify the synergistic effect of SNP pairs by comparing the relative strength of the association between a pair of SNPs and a disease trait with the strength of the associations between two individual SNPs and the disease trait. A few of these alternatives were tested in the context of our method and did not provide the significant results we achieved with the metric above. We designed the above hygeSSI measure because it explicitly captures the interaction between combinations of specific genotypes of two loci.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Construction of SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction networks</title><p id="Par54">We constructed SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction networks to serve as the basis for the pathway-level interaction&#x000a0;tests based on each of the disease model assumptions.

The RR and DD interaction networks were computed based on the hygeSSI metric, and only positive interactions were kept in the network (i.e., where the joint effect of the SNP&#x02013;SNP pair under the corresponding disease model was stronger than any marginal or alternative combination of SNPs). In addition to the above three networks, we also constructed a hybrid SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network in which interactions under recessive and dominant disease model could coexist. To do this, we integrated all four networks (RR, DD, RD, and DR) into a single network (RD-combined) by taking the maximum hygeSSI among the four interaction networks for each pair of SNPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Measuring pathway&#x02013;pathway interactions</title><p id="Par55">For each pair of pathways, we want to test if the number of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions between them is significantly higher than expected given the overall density of the SNP&#x02013;SNP network as well as the marginal interaction density of the two pathways involved. Enrichment analysis based on SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions is much more computationally challenging, and thus we choose to binarize the hygeSSI values (based on a lenient threshold) to make follow-up computation efficient and scalable. After binarization, we divided the SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network into two networks based whether the joint mutation of a SNP pair is more prevalent in the case or control group, which we refer to as the risk and protective networks, respectively.</p><p id="Par56">For each pathway&#x02013;pathway interaction, we first removed the common SNPs shared between two pathways. Then, we test if the observed SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction density between two pathways is significantly higher than expected globally (the global network density) and locally (the marginal density of SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions of the two pathways). Specifically, the marginal density of a pathway is calculated as the SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction density between the SNPs mapped to the pathway and all other SNPs in the network.

The primary permutation applied was to permute the SNP labels, for which 100,000&#x02013;200,000 permutations were used for each dataset analyzed. The sample (case&#x02013;control label) permutation approach mentioned above was used in addition to the SNP permutation strategy to estimate our false discovery rate across all discovered interactions. For each of the 10 sample permutations, we ran the full set of 100,000&#x02013;200,000 SNP permutations. This hybrid approach provides a robust estimate of significance of the discovered pathway interactions and properly corrects for multiple testing.</p><p id="Par59">We also conducted a study to explore the sensitivity of our FDR estimation on the number of sample permutations. Specifically, for the PD-NIA dataset, we performed 1000 sample permutations (and 200,000 SNP permutations within each of these) to derive an estimate of FDR for discoveries in this dataset (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM27" ref-type="media">23</xref>). As shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>, the FDRs estimated from 10 sample permutations show reasonable agreement to FDRs estimated from 1000 sample permutations (Pearson&#x02019;s correlation of 0.81).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Selection of disease models and density thresholds</title><p id="Par60">The method we proposed for pathway-level detection of genetic interactions is general in the sense that any disease model (e.g., RR, DD, RD-combined, and AA) or interaction statistic could be used to discover pathway-level interactions. In this study, we focus on prioritizing a single disease model per disease cohort for full analysis by our pipeline to limit the complexity of data analysis across the 13 GWAS cohorts we explored with our method. Here, we describe the strategy we used to select the disease model to focus on for each GWAS dataset.</p><p id="Par61">To prioritize the disease model and SNP&#x02013;SNP interaction network density threshold for each dataset, we first performed a pilot experiment in which we examined combinations of different disease models and different density thresholds, but with fewer SNP permutations (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM25" ref-type="media">21</xref>). To exclude SNP pairs with little or weak interactions from our analysis, we required each SNP pair&#x02019;s hygeSSI score to be at least 0.2 before applying density-based binarization. For each combination, we performed 10,000 SNP-pathway membership permutations (as compared to 100,000&#x02013;200,000 for a complete run) to estimate FDRs using a similar procedure as that described in the section &#x0201c;Correction for multiple hypothesis testing&#x0201d;, except that SNP permutations were used to estimate FDR instead of sample permutations, as sample permutations are much more computationally expensive. On the basis of this pilot experiment in each cohort, we chose the disease model and density threshold combination that resulted in the lowest estimated FDR for the top-most significant pathway&#x02013;pathway interaction. The rationale for using such a pilot experiment is to identify the disease model that is most likely to discover significant pathway-level interactions while limiting the computational burden of applying our approach to several GWAS cohorts under multiple disease models. Based on these pilot experiments, which were performed for all 13 cohorts, we ran the complete BridGE pipeline, including 100,000&#x02013;200,000 SNP permutations and 10 sample permutations with the disease model and network density threshold chosen from the pilot experiments. The results of pilot experiments for all cohorts are reported in Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM25" ref-type="media">21</xref>, and all full BPM discovery results for all diseases can be found in Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM22" ref-type="media">18</xref> as well a summary in Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">8</xref>.

The relative frequency of interactions under a dominant vs. a recessive model may be largely due to our increased power to detect interactions between SNPs with dominant effects compared to recessive effects. More specifically, individuals with both heterozygous and homozygous (minor allele) genotypes at two interacting loci would be affected under a dominant disease model, while only individuals with homozygous (minor allele) genotypes would be affected in a recessive disease model. The number of individuals homozygous at two interacting loci can be quite small depending on the allele frequency, which limits our power to discover them. Thus, the larger number of discoveries based on a dominant model assumption relative to a recessive model is likely a reflection of difference in statistical power and not an indication that genetic interactions among alleles with dominant effects are contributing more strongly to disease risk. We observed that interactions derived from an additive disease model provided the fewest significant discoveries when used in the context of BridGE based on the pilot experiments (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM25" ref-type="media">21</xref>). To understand this, we investigated whether the SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions supporting the BPMs discovered under the combined dominant&#x02013;recessive model for the PD-NIA cohort were non-additive when evaluated using a logistic regression-based interaction test as opposed to the direct association tests used for our dominant and recessive disease models. Most SNP&#x02013;SNP interactions supporting the PD-NIA discoveries were indeed non-additive when assessed using the logistic regression framework, but these were not necessarily ranked among the highest SNP&#x02013;SNP pairs when assessed in the context of a logistic regression model (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM26" ref-type="media">22</xref>), which may explain the difference in results under the additive vs. recessive or dominant disease models. An important distinction between the SNP-level interaction metric we use is that we specifically identify the small subset of individuals with the appropriate combination of genotypes (dominant model: heterozygous for minor allele at two candidate loci; recessive model: homozygous for minor allele at two candidate loci), and directly test for association with the disease phenotype, whereas for the additive model, an interaction term must explain a sufficient fraction of the variance across the entire population for it to reach significance. This distinction may play a role in why we are able to discover pathway-level genetic interactions with the metric proposed here but rarely with a standard additive model. It is worth noting that the core of the BridGE approach, discovering genetic interactions in aggregate rather than in isolation, is readily adaptable to other disease models or other statistical measures of interaction.
