Complex study designs have the potential to address this concern, though they remain undervalued by investigators due to the lack of proper analysis methods. The primary challenge in the analysis of complex microarray study data is handling the correlation structure within data while also dealing with the combination of large number of genetic measurements and small number of subjects that are ubiquitous even in standard microarray studies. Motivated by the lack of available methods for analysis of repeatedly measured phenotypic or transcriptomic data, herein we develop a longitudinal linear combination test (LLCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">LLCT is a two-step method to analyze multiple longitudinal phenotypes when there is high dimensionality in response and/or explanatory variables. Alternating between calculating within-subjects and between-subjects variations in two steps, LLCT examines if the maximum possible correlation between a linear combination of the time trends and a linear combination of the predictors given by the gene expressions is statistically significant. A generalization of this method can handle family-based study designs when the subjects are not independent. This method is also applicable to time-course microarray, with the ability to identify gene sets that exhibit significantly different expression patterns over time. Based on the results from a simulation study, LLCT outperformed its alternative: pathway analysis via regression. LLCT was shown to be very powerful in the analysis of large gene sets even when the sample size is small.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This self-contained pathway analysis method is applicable to a wide range of longitudinal genomics, proteomics, metabolomics (OMICS) data, allows adjusting for potentially time-dependent covariates and works well with unbalanced and incomplete data.

Longitudinal studies can provide information regarding age of onset along with time-varying covariates that may aid in our understanding of a complex disease. A primary concern of these study designs is to find a proper analysis method which deals best with the correlation structure imposed by longitudinal data. Within-subject correlation in the context of high dimensional data cannot be addressed by traditional statistical analysis methods.</p><p id="Par25">In the past two decades, there has been an increasing interest in microarray studies which has triggered rapid advances in microarray data analysis methods. From 2001, a considerable amount of literature has been published on methods of Individual Gene Analysis (IGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and Gene Set Analysis (GSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Majority of these studies have proposed enrichment methods for binary and categorical phenotypes. Little attention has been paid to developing the methods for other phenotypes, especially longitudinal ones. The current paper contributes to filling this gap by proposing a longitudinal linear combination test (LLCT).</p><p id="Par26">A frequent practice to deal with longitudinal phenotypes in genetics studies is to simply average across the multiple measurements. With this approach, the temporal variation of the phenotype is discarded and part of the information is lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, the only GSA method developed to analyze longitudinal phenotype is the Pathway Analysis via Regression (PAVR) method proposed by Adewale et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This method utilizes regression modelling to analyze binary, multi-class, continuous, count, rate, survival and longitudinal data and adjusts the results for potential covariates. In this method, the measure of association of a specific gene set with the phenotype is a sum of squares of Wald statistics from regression models fitted on the phenotype against the individual genes in the pathway of interest. We will compare this method with LLCT and discuss its limitations, later in this manuscript.</p><p id="Par27">Our goal is to develop a statistical method which not only tackles the limitations of available methods, but addresses challenges of complex designs in recent microarray studies. The main function of this method is to recognize differentially expressed gene sets associated with a phenotype trajectory over time. It is also applicable to family-based study designs when the subjects are not independent. A generalization of this method can handle time-course microarray studies and identify gene sets with significantly different expression patterns over time.</p><p id="Par28">Longitudinal microarray studies may wish to consider the trajectories of both phenotypes and gene expressions. In time-course microarray studies, arrays are collected repeatedly over time, allowing one to examine the dynamic behavior of gene expressions. GSA methods for time-course gene expressions have received more attention than GSA methods for repeated measurements of phenotypes. These methods are exploratory in nature, clustering genes to co-expressed groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Unfortunately, this development is not sufficient to address biologists&#x02019; concerns about the association of gene expressions trajectories with one or more specific covariate(s). Many procedures have been proposed for time-course microarray experiments to test if specific genes exhibit different expression profiles significantly associated with covariates. ANOVA-based methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and regression-based approaches are very popular in this field. Linear Mixed Models (LMM) or Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) are more mature statistical models accommodating the correlations between repeated measurements. However, they are not directly applicable, as the time-course expression data is often collected for a large number of genes, but only for few subjects. To deal with the high dimensionality problem, Turner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] modeled the genes separately and then rescaled the data using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) estimates to accommodate the correlation between the genes within gene sets. LMMs were also used in the methods developed by Hejblum et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and Conesa et al. (maSigPro method) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but they only work with categorical predictor variables. Our proposed method, LLCT can handle both categorical and continuous predictors.</p><p id="Par29">Family-based data is another type of complex design in microarray studies. Family-based study designs are advantageous compared to studies of unrelated subjects in terms of lower genomic or phenotypic heterogeneity. Also, we are more likely to detect any significant effect when we observe multiple copies of the significant effects in a family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Over the past few decades, study designs incorporating information from related subjects have resulted in better scientific interpretations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">LLCT is a GSA method. Incorporating information about the group of genes which are linked via biological pathways, LLCT aims to discover gene sets associated with the phenotype trajectories. These biological pathways, or a-priori defined gene sets, are archived in online databases: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Keyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], BioCarta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Molecular Signature Database of the Broad Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] . Although imposing additional complexity into the analysis, this feature of LLCT is biologically very appealing. In contrast to IGA, GSA works based on a biologically realistic assumption that the genes are not independent and a cell&#x02019;s function can be accomplished by differential expression of a group of genes, even if all of them show only weak to moderate changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">LLCT is a self-contained method. Methodological reviews on GSA emphasize the distinction between self-contained and competitive GSA. A competitive method employs gene permutation to test whether the association between a gene set and the outcome is equal to those of the other gene sets (so-called &#x0201c;Q1 hypothesis&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]). A self-contained method employs subject permutation to test the equality of the two mean vectors of gene set expressions corresponding to the two groups (so-called &#x0201c;Q2 hypothesis&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]). Since competitive methods have been widely criticized for their inability to take care of the correlation within gene sets, we focus here on developing a self-contained method testing the Q2 hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Simulation study</title><p id="Par32">We present here results of our simulation study on LLCT performance. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the power of LLCT analyzing diverse sets of data, simulated by considering different within-gene-set and within-subject correlations, sample and gene set sizes, and the number of repeated measurements. For each plot, the type I error was constant at 0.05 and the simulated data were similar for all characteristics except the one mentioned at the top of the plot. The power was calculated at the presence of different &#x00392;<sub>3</sub> values, determining the effect of each gene within specific gene set over time. The power of LLCT increased by higher within-gene-set correlation, sample size and gene set size (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a-c). However, it remains unaffected by within-subject correlation and number of repeated measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d-e).The power of LLCT and PAVR were compared in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, where we let within-gene-set correlation, sample size, gene set size, and number of repeated measurements change. PAVR does not distinguish between the gene effect and the gene effect over time. Therefore, two parameters of &#x00392;<sub>1</sub> and &#x00392;<sub>3</sub> were set at different values (other than zero for both) to define alternative hypotheses for this method. However, the power of LLCT was consistent over different values of &#x00392;<sub>1</sub> and altered by &#x00392;<sub>3</sub> only. For small within-gene-set correlation values (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.5), LLCT significantly outperformed PAVR. However, as the within-gene-set correlation increased, the power values of PAVR and LLCT became closer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b, c). Comparing with LLCT, PAVR performed poorly when the sample was small (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, e). Furthermore, different gene set sizes did not make a considerable difference between the methods&#x02019; powers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f, g). LLCT exhibited a better ability in dealing with large number of repeated measurements over time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h, i).

GAW19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the focus of our work, is based on data from San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS), conducted to investigate the genetics of cardiovascular disease in Mexican-Americans. GAW19 researchers were divided into different teams to work on heterogeneous statistical methods dealing with longitudinal datasets. For analysis of gene expressions, these teams independently worked on different areas of individual or pathway gene analysis, unrelated or family-based analysis and joint or separated analysis of phenotypes. However, utilizing heterogeneous statistical methods prevented them from replicating their findings.</p><p id="Par37">The subjects of SAFHS were born in a large, multi-generational family and their stated pedigree relationships were verified. The transcriptional profile data of 647 people was recorded, including 16,383 gene expression measurements, for each individual.

By applying the proposed method to this family-based data, we detected differentially expressed gene sets significantly associated with blood pressure trajectories over time.

Comparing the results of the analysis of multiple phenotypes, pulse pressure displayed higher level of robustness and was less affected by covariates. Also, HTN failed to reflect the changes of SBP and DBP and mostly failed to agree with the analysis results of other phenotypes. From a statistical perspective, the result of HTN analysis is limited because the information is lost by dichotomizing the continuous variables. Also, many biological studies doubted the reliability of this one-size-fits-all stratification scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The other noteworthy finding of this study was the difference between SBP and DBP trajectories in their association with gene expressions.

Aging leads to prolonged exposure, accumulation of DNA damages, and elevated production of ROS at the molecular level. In order to preserve genomic stability under ROS-induced stress, multiple pathways to repair or respond to the presence of DNA damage are employed by the cell and their functions may overlap, compromise or exceed the capability to repair DNA. A defective DNA repair system leads to genomic instability and can accelerate development of vascular problems, such as increased blood pressure, increased vascular stiffness, and decreased vascular relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

This was the first attempt to analyze gene sets when the blood pressure is repeatedly measured, and the data set is clustered by families. Analysis at the gene set level improves interpretability of findings. Incorporating repeated measurements of outcome over time enables us to investigate the temporal progression of phenotype over time. These studies provide the opportunity to investigate genomics under an important assumption: the effects of the genes contributing to the underlying phenotype are persistent over time. Also, the potential genetic and environmental covariates are better controlled via longitudinal study design. The family-based structure of data decreases heterogeneity leading to more precise investigations. The previous works in GAW19 never had these three features together. Although this study is unique in its kind, our findings have been shown to be mostly consistent with those of experimental or GWAS studies. However, we recognize that our study may not present the best set of pathways involved in blood pressure development because of the following limitations. The first limitation, albeit common among genomic studies, is that a single significant gene may lead to the significance of the whole pathway. Second, although we adjusted for anti-hypertensive intake and smoking status, there are many other uncontrolled covariates, such as diet, stress, and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

Consistently, we observed these three pathways underwent significantly distinct expression patterns in all three stages in association with the wound organ with a sharper increasing trend within the first 24&#x02009;h after the skin injury. In agreement with Chen et al.

The lower activation of immune processes during mucosal wound recovery prevents the chronic inflammation and decreases fibrosis and scarring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Our analysis showed that the skin and mucosal cells took differential expression patterns of inflammatory and immune factors in different states with a higher peak expression at 12 or 24&#x02009;h after injury for skin wound and a subsequent steeper decline by Day 7. Although all the immune system pathways were upregulated before wounding, the basal pathway of Fc <italic>&#x003b5;</italic> RI signaling expressed at the same level for different wound organs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a).

Apoptosis and autophagy are known as a &#x0201c;programmed cell death&#x0201d;, which when inhibited, a new type of cell death, necroptosis, occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In our study, the apoptosis, necroptosis and autophagy were differentially regulated over different types of skin and tongue samples. The higher upregulation of apoptosis in skin samples during the time course of wound healing compared to mucosal samples were also reported by Johnson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. This study discussed that while apoptosis occurs predominantly through the intrinsic pathway in the healing mucosa, it occurs predominantly through the extrinsic pathway in skin samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In contrast to apoptosis pathway, the necroptosis and autophagy expressions at basal were statistically identical for both wound organs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b-c). As necroptosis expression is regulated by secretion of cytokines/chemokines, its post-injury fluctuations resemble that of cytokines/chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. However, Autophagy regulates and is regulated by the inflammatory cytokine and chemokines, and therefore, its expression values did not reflect well the trajectories of cytokine and chemokine expressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Signal transduction</title><p id="Par68">Having the same level of oral MAPK expression at unwounded state, skin cells responded immediately to the injury through overexpression of MAPK signaling pathway in the first day followed by a consistent decline afterwards. In contrast, the expression of this pathway in tongue cells remained approximately unchanged after wounding and started increasing in proliferation state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). The level of MAPK signaling pathway expression for skin wound stayed lower than that of tongue wound in proliferation state. This pattern also resembles the observed pattern of RAS in this study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). The RAS and MAPK pathways play a critical role in regulation of cell proliferation through a series of protein kinase cascades and their upregulation at proliferation phase in tongue wounds can help the wound rebuild [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">Several evidences suggested the induction of tenascin-C, a fibroblast marker whose expression is necessary for accelerated wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], by several growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. This association is regulated by neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Therefore, the increasing expression pattern of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction in the tongue cells, in contrast to the plateau and slightly decreasing pattern of that in the skin cells, could explain the rapid oral healing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Metabolism</title><p id="Par70">Glycosaminoglycan is a major component of connective tissue and play an important regulatory role in extracellular matrix production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Our observation of distinct expression patterns of glycosaminoglycan in dermal and mucosal wounds over different wound healing stages accords the previous finding that suggested their distinctive features and quantities of glycosaminoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. While expressed at the same level at unwounded state, the pathway of glycosaminoglycan degradation was overexpressed in the late hemostasis state and early inflammatory stage in tongue wound which helps coagulation, inhibits enzymes and cytotoxic mediators released from proinflammatory cells, and improves recruitment of inflammatory cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g). The pathway of glycosaminoglycan degradation was greatly overregulated in late inflammatory state and over proliferation state of healing the skin wound. The excess expression of Heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, inhibits the activity of the FGF-7, which regulates keratinocytes migration and proliferation and therefore impedes the tissue development process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Nervous system</title><p id="Par71">Distinct response of Cholinergic Synapse pathway was observed in different wound organs. While Cholinergic Synapse pathway of skin wound reaches its highest expression level at day 1, the expression of this pathway in tongue tissue peaks at day 5 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). In agreement, Anderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] observed Acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme located at neuromuscular and central cholinergic synapse, to be highly expressed at day 1. They found the important role of Acetylcholinesterase in cell migration and fibroblast wound healing. Therefore, the increasing trend of theexpression of Cholinergic Synapse pathway in tongue sample by day 5 accounts for the speedy mucosal repair.</p><p id="Par72">Our results suggested that tissue repair is a complex process involving multiple gene pathways. Our pattern analysis also suggested that the mucosal wounds required a less demanding procedure to repair, characterized by many invariant time-course expressions patterns, in comparison with the dermal wounds. We identified the important role of Fc <italic>&#x003b5;</italic> RI signaling pathway in regulating the inflammatory mediators and the critical roles of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cholinergic synapse and MAPK and RAS pathways in promoting the different healing phases. We also recognized the destructive effect of excess expression of glycosaminoglycan degradation in proliferation phase. All these findings improve our understanding of the molecular pathways and may contribute in devising new strategies for successful wounds treatment. We believe that a study of the time-course correlations between different gene pathways would also help advancing the grasp of the underlying transcriptome system.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par73">The interest in temporal patterns of change in the patients&#x02019; conditions is becoming increasingly popular, as it aids in the explanation of complex biological systems. Longitudinal studies provide the possibility to study individual development of an outcome over time, and in doing so advance our understanding of disease progression or phenotype trajectory. Through longitudinal studies, the development of other variables can also be examined as determinants of the outcome trajectories. Therefore, incorporating longitudinal designs in genetic studies enable examination of genetic variants that affect phenotypes over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Moreover, longitudinal studies are more reliable as the subjects are closely followed up with and the onset of the events is precisely observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Obviously, there is higher certainty behind the existence of an effect that is detected to be continuously significant over time in the presence of many uncontrolled or unmeasured time-dependent covariates than an effect that is observed only once. In other words, multiple measurements and significant trajectory over time provide more reliable evidence than what a single time point measurement and a cross-sectional effect can provide. Adding family structure to the study design can improve this reliability by detecting a significant genetic effect in a family rather than simply an individual.</p><p id="Par74">The main purpose of the current study was to develop a statistical method for high-dimensional data able to analyze repeatedly-measured outcomes and covariates. This method offers many interesting flexibilities to the analysis. It allows adjusting for potentially time-dependent covariates. Since genetics and environment always interact to shape the phenotype, the result of genetics studies alone may be biased when environmental factors are not taken into account. A very common drawback of many available GSA methods is the lack of ability to accommodate between-gene correlation, which our proposed LLCT addresses. In addition, LLCT is a self-contained method proven to be powerful and computationally efficient compared to existing methods. Being a self-contained method, LLCT is also expected to result in high reproducibility, high power and high robustness to the sample heterogeneity, as applied on RNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. This method can be applied to different classes of phenotypes, such as continuous, binary or categorical phenotype if an appropriate model is defined in the first stage. Furthermore, it is applicable to both unbalanced and incomplete data, which is important in longitudinal studies as some subjects are often lost to follow up. The evidence from the simulation study suggests higher power of LLCT in comparison to existing method, PAVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Aside from higher power of LLCT, there are two critical features that discriminate these two methods. First, LLCT is computationally far more efficient. Compared to LLCT, the run time is about 70 times longer for PAVR. For the same reason, we could not design a large simulation for evaluation of PAVR. Second, PAVR is unable to test the interaction of time and covariate over time and it only tests the covariate effect. The interaction of time and covariate indicates if the covariate&#x02019;s effect varies over time; which is known to be the most critical parameter of longitudinal analysis. Without considering this parameter, the longitudinal study resembles a cross-sectional study that takes advantage of multiple measurements for gaining higher accuracy of measurements. Our simulation study also showed that the power, and therefore the required sample size, is dependent on the gene set size and the within-gene-set correlation and it is independent on the number of repeated measurements and within-subjects correlation. Moreover, Significance of a set exhibiting lower between-genes correlations can be achieved with a smaller sample size..</p><p id="Par75">Despite the strengths mentioned above, there are a few limitations for this method that need to be considered. Our method for dealing with longitudinal phenotype is unable to adjust for time-independent covariates. Including time-independent covariates in the second step of the method may result in misleading findings. As a self-contained method, LLCT would identify a set as significant even if a small number of genes, or even if one single gene is associated with the phenotype. One way to address this limitation is to consider reducing the significant sets to their core members. In time-course microarray data analysis, this method can identify the gene sets which are differentially expressed over time in association with a set of covariates. However, our method is unable to distinguish the individual covariates responsible for this difference, unless we include one covariate at a time. Resembling the mixed effect models, LLCT assumes the expressions of the genes within a geneset can be characterized by the same type of model. If the study includes the genes with differential patterns of expression which could not be characterized by a single type of model, spline models should be used. The researcher may also consider analysis of the expression trajectory in the time subperiods.</p><p id="Par76">LLCT was applied to GAW19 data. As noted earlier, GAW19 has been analyzed before. However, significant differences across various methods used prevented a meaningful comparison of the results. There are four pedigree-based GAW19 studies exploring the association between phenotype and gene expressions via different methods: linear mixed models, nonparametric weighted U statistics, structural equation modeling, Bayesian unified frameworks, and multiple regression. However, their results cannot be compared with ours because of the following differences in the analytical approaches: (1) They incorporated the information of rare variants into their analysis while this study examined the transcriptome variations only; (2) In contrast to our GSA approach, they did not include the priori information of gene pathways; (3) They did not take the longitudinal pattern of the phenotype into the account. There are seven GAW19 pathway-based analysis, three of which explored gene expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. There are three GAW19 studies with longitudinal analytical approaches, all of them examining genetic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The longitudinal studies used GEE, latent class growth modeling (LCGM), LMM, and variance components (VC) in their analysis. Among all these studies, the study of Ziyatdinov et al., which is a gene ontology pathway and family-based enrichment analysis of gene-expression data using the mixed effect models, came closest to the current study, but it is unpublished at the time of submission of this work. GAW19 studies acknowledged higher power of longitudinal methods in detecting genetic effects, decreased trait heterogeneity and smaller standard error of effect estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Also, they identified unique genetic-related trajectories of disease progression missed by the previous studies.</p><p id="Par77">We demonstrated the applicability of LLCT on analysis of time-course microarray data in the second application. Contrary to the first application, LLCT dealt with a binary phenotype collected from mice samples in this application. The data was previously analyzed using ANOVA for comparing the expression level at each post-wounding time with that of unwounded state. In order to gain some understanding of the underlying expression dynamics, the temporal trajectories of the genes which were differentially expressed were K-means clustered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The inherent assumptions of this clustering method limit the ability to describe the differential dynamic behaviour of the genes and, also, do not provide a test of time-course diversities.</p><p id="Par78">Although we found many phenotype-relevant gene sets in our application, that are supported by previous studies, a future study comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the LLCT applied to a large number of longitudinal studies is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par79">The proposed LLCT method can be used for analysis of complex genetic studies and may result in better reproducibility across studies. LLCT can be applied to a wide range of longitudinal genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiota data. A very important application of LLCT is to link omics over time - an approach that has been emphasized by recent studies for gaining better understanding of complex biological process. Linkage of omics over time requires a method that can handle large scale outcomes and predictors datasets, simultaneously, which cannot be accommodated by most methods. Our method has strong potential to contribute to the progression of genetic science.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Longitudinal linear combination test (LLCT)</title><p id="Par80">We propose a two-step method to analyze multiple longitudinal phenotypes when there is high dimensionality in either the response or explanatory variables. In the first step, within-subject variation is analyzed. The changing trend of outcomes over time is estimated using an appropriate model for the structure and type of the data. In the second step, LCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] is applied to analyze the between-subject variation. In this step, LCT is employed to examine if the maximum possible correlation between a linear combination of the time trends and a linear combination of the predictors given by the gene expressions is statistically significant. We generalized our method to accommodate data generated by two complex study designs: time-course microarray studies and family-based studies. A time-course study measures gene expression repeatedly over time and is designed to find the correlation between time trajectory of gene-expressions and covariates. A family-based design collects the information from family members and examines the association between longitudinal phenotypes and gene expressions, while taking care of the correlation between subjects within each family.</p><p id="Par81">We borrowed the main idea of this method from mixed effect modelling wherein the variation in the longitudinal phenotype is modelled taking two steps: first step, the within-subject variation is modelled; in the second step, the between-subject variation is modeled using the coefficients estimated in the first step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Roughly the same strategy is also practiced by Conesa et al.

However, this method can be generalized to work with other type of data, such as binary or categorical response variable, using an appropriate link function in the first step.

It can also adjust for time-variant covariates. Next, we describe the two steps of the method, followed by two generalizations.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title><italic>Analysis of Within-Subject Variation (Step 1)</italic></title><p id="Par83">Consider a microarray study on I subjects where longitudinal phenotypes of size M is measured for <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> times for the <italic>i</italic> th subject, <italic>i</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, &#x02026;, <italic>I</italic>.
