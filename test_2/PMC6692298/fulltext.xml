It is low estimates that at least 700,000 people die from AMR infections each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The emergence and worldwide spread of multiple-resistant &#x0201c;superbugs&#x0201d; cause an urgent need of novel antimicrobial medicine. A prospective weapon to fight against antimicrobial-resistant infections is antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs are a class of small cationic peptides, usually within 100 amino acid residues, produced by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi, animals and plants, and have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, immune regulation, wound healing, mediating apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The first reported AMP, melittin, was isolated from bee venoms by Habermann <italic>et al</italic>. in 1952<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. After that, a large number of natural AMPs have been reported, and these peptides were considered to be important components of their host defense system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

According to the expected results, Phase III clinical trials (NCT03237325) is recruiting patients now.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Application of DRAMP</title><p id="Par21">DRAMP has been visited by more than 85,000 people since its opening, and cited by different research groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Cipcigan <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> used known natural sequences whose lengths are 13 or 14 in DRAMP to mimic the insertion mechanism of AMPs. These AMPs have antibacterial activity against <italic>staphylococcus aureus</italic> and the MIC values were provided by DRAMP. The insertion depth of each AMP was calculated by molecular dynamics, and the average hydrophilicity of the AMPs was scored by GRAVY. It was found that the hydrophobicity of the AMPs was positively correlated with the insertion depth of the AMPs against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. It means that the higher hydrophobicity is, the deeper AMPs insert into <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> membrane. Therefore, it is pretty advantageous to flexibly use various AMP databases and bioinformatics tools to develop AMPs.</p><p id="Par23">Nowadays in the field of data mining, machine learning has been receiving extensive attention with its powerful capabilities of data processing and application potential. In general, due to the limited 3D structures of experimentally determined AMPs, most AMP classifiers are based on 2D descriptors. Such as, CAMP<sub>R3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, ADAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, and AntiBP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> identify AMPs, BAGEL4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and BACTIBASE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> mainly identify bacteriocins. We have developed a machine learning model based on 3D descriptors to predict AMPs and evaluate their antimicrobial effects by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The accuracy of the experimental optimal model in the training dataset is 92.59% and MCC is 0.84. The accuracy of this model in the independent test dataset is 100.00% and MCC is 1.00. We used this model to guide the rational design of 5 new AMPs, and the result of antibacterial assay was consistent with the predicted results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This predictive classifier will be added to DRAMP to help researchers identify and rationally design AMPs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par24">The research of AMPs is based on its broad-spectrum antibacterial, low resistance, immunomodulatory and antitumor advantages. Although some AMPs have entered clinical stage, there are still numerous obstacles to be solved, including: side effects (hemolysis, cytotoxicity, etc.), protease hydrolysis, sensitivity to salt or serum, high cost of large-scale production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">To tackle the problems, DRAMP will provide more complete and detailed information about AMPs. In DRAMP 2.0, 5,084 General AMPs, 14,739 patent entries, and 76 clinical entries are embodied. There are 2,550 new entries added to the DRAMP compared with the previous version. We supplemented the hemolytic data and provided predicted structures for 82 entries, constructed by homology modelling and molecular dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. These predicted structures have been used to design 3D descriptor-based AMP classifier by our lab, and the result of the antibacterial assay for the 5 designed AMPs confirmed that was consistent with the predicted results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This model will become a part of the DRAMP prediction module. Furthermore, we have added a relationship map of classification by activity in the readme page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/static/readme.php">http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/static/readme.php</ext-link>). Compared with the DRAMP&#x000a0;1.0, we have separated &#x02018;Anti-Gram+&#x02019; and &#x02018;Anti-Gram-&#x02019; from the antibacterial activity and added &#x02018;Antimicrobial&#x02019;, &#x02018;Antiparasitic&#x02019; with them to the browse page.</p><p id="Par26">More importantly, DRAMP 2.0 has shared all the data and annotations as well as the source code of the website with download links. We hope that the shared data will promote international cooperation, and accelerate the progress of antimicrobial research.

However, numerous failed precedents indicate that many problems need to be overcome. In order to solve the problem that AMPs are easily hydrolyzed by protease, and to make AMPs more accurately target their expected sites, the modification of AMPs by the targeted nano-delivery system can decrease protease degradation or environmental influences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> discovered that polyionic complex (PIC) micelles formed by self-assembly of MSI-78 and the anionic copolymer methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(&#x003b1;-glutamic acid) (mPEG-b-PGlu) can be sustainably released <italic>in vivo</italic> to improve the stability, reduce hemolytic properties without affecting its antimicrobial activity. As for increasing antibacterial properties of AMPs, Godoy-Gallardo <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> immobilized hLF1-11 on five different titanium surface coatings, found that bacterial adhesion decreased and biomembrance formation was affected. The safety of AMPs is the biggest problem that hinders the passage of AMPs through clinical trials. Jin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> found that hemolysis can be reduced if hydrophobic residues insert into the hydrophilic side of the helical structure. Ahmad <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> replaced L-Leu at &#x02018;a&#x02019; and &#x02018;d&#x02019; positions of the short leucine zipper peptide (SLZP) with D-Leu, which did not almost change in antimicrobial activity but significantly reduced hemolytic activity.</p><p id="Par28">There exist many databases related to AMPs that are directly used by researchers. Not only do they integrate information on a great deal of AMPs, but also provide tools for predicting structures, activities, and toxicities of AMPs. This is also the future scenarios of DRAMP. DRAMP will continue to collect experimentally determined AMPs and re-update all existing data. DRAMP currently schedules to update at least every 3 months, providing more annotations, information and tools to facilitate researchers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Data collection and update</title><p id="Par29">The method of data collection and update is consistent with the first version of DRAMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The AMPs have the following characteristics: (1) less than 100 amino acids in length; (2) a clear mature sequence; (3) determined their activity. All information in the DRAMP is collected from PubMed, Uniprot, PDB and Lens by using keywords such as &#x02018;antimicrobial peptide&#x02019;, &#x02018;antibacterial peptide&#x02019;, &#x02018;antifungal peptide&#x02019;, or &#x02018;hemolytic&#x02019;. DRAMP contains a variety of detailed information of AMPs. In the first version, hemolysis is only annotated in the part of &#x0201c;Comments Information&#x0201d;. The newly hemolytic activities are obtained from literatures with experimental results of hemolytic tests and then added into DRAMP manually. These new annotations include corresponding red blood cells and activity of AMPs for hemolytic tests. DRAMP collects all activity test data as much as possible from papers. In order to prevent the possible errors, we have added literature sources for each data. All sequences and updates are available on the DRAMP website.</p><p id="Par30">DRAMP was built on Apache web server (version 2.2.22) with Linux operating system. HTML, PHP and JavaScript were applied to develop the web interfaces as the front-end. MySQL server (version 5.5.29) was applied to manage the data as the back-end. The original source code of DRAMP website has been shared in GitHub. We have regular updates, backup, recovery and web optimization for DRAMP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Structure data collection and prediction</title><p id="Par31">DRAMP in the first version included the AMP structures that were determined and registered in PDB. However, due to the small number of crystal structures determined in experiment, we used a reasonable method to construct 3D structures of AMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. We used MOE2016 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.chemcomp.com/">https://www.chemcomp.com/</ext-link>) to generate the initial structures for AMPs that do not have a crystal structure, and GB/VI as the scoring standard. Amber14 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ambermd.org/">http://ambermd.org/</ext-link>) with the FF14SB force field was used for molecular dynamics to optimize the structures. A truncated octahedral box was created and the system was solvated using TIP3P water before molecular dynamics. After optimization of system, the temperature was kept at 300&#x02009;K for 100&#x02009;ns and one conformation was reserved every 100&#x02009;ps. The time step was 2&#x02009;fs for all simulations.</p><p id="Par32">In order to verify the accuracy of the predicted results, we performed the same prediction for the molecules which have their crystal structures. The predicted structures are similar to the experimental determined crystal structures, and the RMSD value is less than 2&#x02009;&#x000c5;. Although the predicted structures by the method are reliable, the time of molecular dynamics is pretty long. At present, we have predicted the structures of 82 AMPs (79 of which have no structure in PDB). The 82 predicted structures and download links in pdb format have been uploaded to the corresponding AMP structure information for public downloading and using. For the DRAMP_ID of 82 AMPs, please visit the update page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/static/update.php">http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/static/update.php</ext-link>). In order to prevent confusion between the crystal and the predicted structure, the pdb format files and the pictures of the predicted structures were labeled. We will continue to update the predicted structures of AMPs in the future.</p><p id="Par33">All the data and sequences which are sorted by activity and dataset can be downloaded in Excel format from the DRAMP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/downloads/">http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/downloads/</ext-link>).
