One of these multi-dimensional factors, which has gained increased attention in the oncological field due to its unelucidated role in risk assessment for cancer, is diet. Moreover, as studies advance, a clearer connection between diet and the molecular alteration of patients is becoming identifiable and quantifiable, thereby replacing the old general view associating specific phenotypical changes with the differential intake of nutrients. Respectively, there are two major fields concentrated on the interrelation between genome and diet: nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. Nutrigenetics studies the effects of nutrition at the gene level, whereas nutrigenomics studies the effect of nutrients on genome and transcriptome patterns. By precisely evaluating the interaction between the genomic profile of patients and their nutrient intake, it is possible to envision a concept of personalized medicine encompassing nutrition and health care. The list of nutrients that could have an inhibitory effect on cancer development is quite extensive, with evidence in the scientific literature. The administration of these nutrients showed significant results in vitro and in vivo regarding cancer inhibition, although more studies regarding administration in effective doses in actual patients need to be done.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nutrigenetics</kwd><kwd>nutrigenomics</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>chemoprevention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-medicina-55-00283"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Cancer should not be considered as a single disease, but as a multitude of different genetic (irreversible) and epigenetic alterations (reversible in some situations) that act in tandem, mirrored by changes in patterns exhibited in the transcriptome [<xref rid="B1-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Genetics, simply put, investigates genes, genetic variation and heredity in organisms. The word &#x0201c;epigenetics&#x0201d; literally means &#x0201c;above genetics&#x0201d; and, thus, refers to all the mechanisms that control or regulate gene expression without actually changing the DNA sequence. This means that epigenetic changes encompass all molecular modifications to DNA or chromatin. The most frequent and extensively investigated epigenetic modification that happens post-translationally is DNA methylation [<xref rid="B2-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Examples of genes with some &#x0201c;epigenetic&#x0201d; memory of early life experiences are those related to energy acquisition, storage and use. One such example is leptin, involved in the development of obesity. It encodes a hormone that specifically regulates energy intake and expenditure. It has been proposed that epigenetic variants of leptin could explain the phenomena of low plasma concentrations. More specifically, the promoter region of leptin can be methylated in somatic tissues of humans and, thus, demonstrates epigenetic variation [<xref rid="B2-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>There is great interest in investigating the relationships between the predisposition for different cancers, their associated prognosis and exposure to different risk factors like diet. This inquiry is based on the fact that bioactive agents within daily nutrients hold great promise in oncology [<xref rid="B3-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] because of their capacity to regulate coding or non-coding genes [<xref rid="B4-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and as adjuvant support for cancer therapy [<xref rid="B6-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Nutrigenetics studies nutrition at the gene level, focusing on the way that certain gene variants can influence and are influenced upon by their interaction with nutrients. Nutrigenomics, on the other hand, studies the effects of nutrients on genomic and transcriptomic profiles, and their subsequent consequences on the proteome and metabolome [<xref rid="B7-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. By predicting the functional interactions between nutrients and genomes, the emerging and developing field of personalized medicine can incorporate nutrition, facilitating the step forward toward personalized cancer therapy. This is based on the capacity of certain nutrients to specifically activate cancer inhibitory mechanisms, thereby targeting important hallmarks of cancer like apoptosis or the impairment of angiogenesis [<xref rid="B8-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this review is to evaluate and present the effects that some key micronutrient components (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D and Selenium) and some macronutrients (polyunsaturated fatty acids, prebiotics and probiotics) can have in the prevention and/or therapy of different cancer types. After all, one function of personalized medicine is the identification of critical interactions in the cancer&#x02013;diet relationship specific to the patient and their genome. The nutrients were chosen based on the in vitro or in vivo experimental data available, specifically ensuring that there was an association between the nutrient and a molecular pathway or gene. Furthermore, we wanted to discuss nutrients that are readily accessible and have been well documented.</p><p>As an effect, there are future practical applications regarding personalized nutrition. This promising approach characterizes the genetic variants of each individual, monitoring how they react to a diet in light of the specific personalized nutrient intake. Based on these individual investigations, each person could receive a diet validated to give the optimal results in concordance with their genomic background. The current technologies/techniques used for the study of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are shown in <xref rid="medicina-55-00283-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The demand for determining genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and mutation-specific profile characteristics has led to the implementation of several technologies, some of which are simple and inexpensive technologies, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods [<xref rid="B7-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The more complex and costly technologies consist of microarray, Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing (NGS), mass spectrometry (MS), and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS). They offer more comprehensive information, but are not available on a wide scale. At the same time, the high amount of raw data generated requires specialized bioinformatic analyses executed by specific software and performed in an informed manner by a highly trained bioinformatician [<xref rid="B7-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B14-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2-medicina-55-00283"><title>2. Cancer Risk Represents a Sum of Complex Interactions of Environmental Exposures</title><p>Cancer risk represents the synergy of complex interactions encompassing the exposure to different environmental factors, hereditary genetic alterations and epigenetic modifications. These events are accumulated during genotoxic alterations, as a response to environmental damage [<xref rid="B37-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Hereditary cancers account for 5&#x02013;10% of all cancers; the remaining malignancies can be caused by somatic mutations with consequences of environmental exposure exhibited at the expression level for coding and non-coding genes [<xref rid="B38-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, a chemopreventive and therapeutic effect can be achieved by specifically increasing the concentration of a compound, retrieved naturally from a normal diet in functional foods or in an enriched form as nutraceuticals [<xref rid="B40-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>As previously mentioned, there are two strategies that could offer important missing information, thereby linking environmental exposure to intrinsic cancer risk: nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. Nutrigenetics makes the connection between the human genome, nutrition and exposure, with the gene as the focal point. It has the potential to be exploited for personalized diets, preserving the health state of an individual, preventing the onset of diseases and lastly for adjuvant treatment. The field of nutrigenomics gives a more integrated view of how nutrients effect various gene expressions and, implicitly, the transcript profiles relating to those genes, with direct effect exhibited in proteomic and metabolomic activities [<xref rid="B41-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This field of study was conceived on the assumption that nutrients can influence gene expression by acting directly on the genome [<xref rid="B43-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], or indirectly by means of epigenetic mechanisms. Also, nutrients appear to be able to influence different cellular processes [<xref rid="B9-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], some of which are related to tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B43-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; therefore, one consideration is how certain nutrients have an influence on cancer development or progression [<xref rid="B44-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Natural nutrients are able to disrupt tumorigenesis at multiple &#x02018;omic&#x02019; levels and, concurrently, increase the chemotherapeutic efficacy and reduce the side effects related to these treatments [<xref rid="B46-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. One of the relevant examples is related to oral cancer, which can be arguably prevented by maintaining good oral hygiene, eliminating the use of tobacco and alcohol products, and by having a balanced healthy diet. All these have protective effects and can decrease the risk of oral cancer, in which environmental exposure has the most important role [<xref rid="B47-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The protective effects of a diet rich in vegetables and fruits were demonstrated to reduce the risk of oral cavity and oropharynx malignancies in a Spanish patient cohort, especially among smokers and alcohol drinkers (patients with an already increased risk for oral cancer) [<xref rid="B48-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>It is now well established that one of the risks for cancer development consists in improper diet, which contains an increasing amount of processed foods and high sugar levels, all potentially acting as malignant drivers. Apart from this, it has been assumed by some studies that several nutrients or specific dietary components are able to decrease the possibility of malignant cell transformation; or, moreover, to inhibit the growth and spread of pre-existing malignant masses [<xref rid="B49-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Even if many in vitro studies have shown that specific components from the everyday diet can act as cancer inhibitors, there is still no clear evidence regarding the pro- or anti-carcinogenic characteristics of nutrients. In spite of the large amount of preclinical studies and clinical trials, most of them present only a borderline-significant effect [<xref rid="B51-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>To determine the influence of nutrients on cancer, they can be cross-linked with the hallmarks of cancer through their molecular intermediaries. The most affected cancer hallmark is tumor-promoted inflammation through oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="B52-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The most relevant data are summarized in <xref rid="medicina-55-00283-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicina-55-00283-f001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Nutrition can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the person&#x02019;s genetic profile and variation. An example would be the case of coffee consumption, where certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for alleles identified for GCKR, MLXIPL, BDNF and CYP1A2 could be connected with an excessive intake of coffee; interestingly, these same alleles were initially linked to smoking, adiposity and fasting levels of insulin or glucose [<xref rid="B96-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3-medicina-55-00283"><title>3. Vitamins</title><sec id="sec3dot1-medicina-55-00283"><title>3.1. Vitamin C</title><p>Among the popular vitamins that are widely available in natural fruit or supplement form, vitamin C or ascorbic acid is the most commonly known and taken. Vitamin C concentrations from the plasma of cancer patients were significantly reduced when compared to healthy controls, raising several questions related to cancer and vitamin C involvement [<xref rid="B49-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. To counteract the growth of a malignant tumor mass, Vitamin C can be administered for its dose-dependent anti-carcinogenic properties [<xref rid="B40-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The reported dose-dependent effects of Vitamin C are also specific to cancer type; for example in melanoma, high doses of vitamin C induced apoptosis, whereas low doses promoted cell proliferation [<xref rid="B55-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B97-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. However, it should be noted that even high doses of Vitamin C are not effective against malignant disease. Additionally, there are some unwanted side effects caused by high dose accumulation in normal cells, which can be harmful due to pro-oxidant action, whose effects are observed at millimolar concentrations [<xref rid="B40-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. One of the aforementioned anti-carcinogenic properties attributed to Vitamin C is sensitivity to chemotherapy [<xref rid="B98-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Another anti-carcinogenic property comes from its function as an anti-oxidant; ascorbic acid produces small amounts of hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide quantities generated from high doses of Vitamin C can be lethal to cancer cells due to their low amounts of hydrogen peroxide-processing enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. The accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, through the induction of apoptosis, can eventually lead to tumor cell lysis [<xref rid="B40-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B49-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A case in point is found in human tongue carcinoma cells, where high doses of vitamin C induced anti-tumor effects via the generation of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radicals [<xref rid="B62-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In another study carried out on laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, vitamin C was revealed to activate necrotic cell death mechanisms via ROS (reactive oxygen species) production and the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, causing increased cytosolic calcium [<xref rid="B99-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. It has been established that mice receiving intravenous administration can reach cytotoxic concentrations of vitamin C, similar to the results obtained in vitro [<xref rid="B100-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,<xref rid="B101-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>].</p><p>Dietary vitamin C is generally transferred by two transporter proteins that carry this molecule across cell membranes and modulate oxidative stress: sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter (SVCT) and glucose transporter (GLUT). Moreover, oxidative stress is influenced by the antioxidant enzymes manganese super oxide dismutase (MnSOD), glutathione S-transferase (GS), and haptoglobin (Hp)&#x02014;a protein linked to hemoglobin. The <italic>Hp</italic> gene encodes two structurally different alleles: Hp1 and Hp2. It is this Hp2-2 genotype, observed in 48% of Caucasians and 52% of Asians, that is associated with vitamin C deficiency [<xref rid="B58-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Oxidative stress, in which vitamin C has long been known to be involved, has an effect on apoptosis through regulating Bcl-2, a known anti-apoptotic protein [<xref rid="B102-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Aside from the participation of vitamin C in oxidative stress, it has been shown that this active substance inhibits the formation of N-nitrosamine carcinogenic compounds [<xref rid="B103-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] and modulates immune response [<xref rid="B104-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. These modulatory mechanisms may explain the inverse relationship between the variation in the quantity of ascorbic acid ingested and its effects, as described, on different cancer types: lung, stomach, larynx, breast, colon, head and neck carcinoma [<xref rid="B61-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B99-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,<xref rid="B105-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Vitamin C intake does not only have an effect on cancer prevention. It also has an impact on cancer-related mortality in breast cancer [<xref rid="B106-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], and lowers the necessary doses of chemotherapeutic agent to achieve comparative treatment effects [<xref rid="B107-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. All things considered, the therapeutic role of vitamin C has begun to be more thoroughly investigated.</p><p>A beneficial effect was observed in the case of short-term diet supplementation of vitamin E and C complexes against radiotherapy-induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer [<xref rid="B61-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In addition, another protective-like effect from dietary vitamin C intake was observed in a patient cohort of forty-one men with squamous cell oral or pharyngeal cancer, when compared to 398 male healthy control subjects [<xref rid="B108-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. In conclusion, epidemiological studies revealed that vitamin C can reduce the risk of malignancies [<xref rid="B109-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,<xref rid="B110-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. However, one must not forget that the beneficial effects of vitamin C cannot be separated from the beneficial effects of a healthy diet rich in fruits or vegetables [<xref rid="B108-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>,<xref rid="B110-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-medicina-55-00283"><title>3.2. Vitamin A</title><p>Dietary vitamin A is a product derived from a variety of carotenoids found in plants, with a broad range of beneficial effects on human health. It not only acts as an antioxidant, protecting against oxidative stress and DNA damage, but also at the cellular level, it modulates cell growth while regulating methylation. Vitamin A is considered to have a more complex mechanism of action that is currently being investigated [<xref rid="B53-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], consisting in a wide range of biochemical and immunological roles against cancer [<xref rid="B111-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. For example, a study revealed that vitamin A reduced oral mucositis, a consequence of chemotherapy [<xref rid="B112-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Vitamin A or its related analogs, the retinoids, were demonstrated to have the capacity to reduce head, neck and lung carcinogenesis in animal models [<xref rid="B113-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>].

Thirdly, infectious agents can induce immunosuppression and consequently reduce immunosurveillance [<xref rid="B188-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>].

The recent in vitro and in vivo study results are promising, with an indication that probiotic bacteria reduce the risk, incidence and number of colon, liver or bladder tumors. This protective effect against cancer development can be ascribed to multiple general biological explanations: enhancing the immune system of the host, modulating oxidative stress and inflammation, or maintaining the healthy bacterial populations such that they outcompete/suppress bacteria that produce carcinogens. However, more specifically, probiotic intake is currently associated with the components from lactic bacteria capable of modulating immune response, principally by the regulation of several factors like interleukins (Interleukin-12) and tumor necrosis factors (TNF&#x003b1;), concurrently improving the cytokine-associated pathways [<xref rid="B91-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="B193-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>,<xref rid="B194-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, prebiotics and gut microbiota are in direct relationship with a wide range of pathologies like obesity or inflammatory processes [<xref rid="B195-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Both insoluble and soluble dietary fibers can affect the intestinal bastion&#x02019;s absorption rate. Moreover, an extensive selection of xenobiotics are reported to be involved with cancer chemoprevention mechanisms [<xref rid="B83-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. For example, as presented in <xref rid="medicina-55-00283-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, for the cases of stomach and ovarian cancer, an inverse relationship was observed between cancer risk and various types of fibers derived from vegetables and fruits [<xref rid="B85-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. At the same time, breast cancer protection by dietary fibers was achieved either by blocking the intestinal absorption of estrogens released by biliary systems, or by modulating insulin-like growth factors and insulin resistance [<xref rid="B81-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].</p><p>The gene exchanges within the gut microbiota were demonstrated to be more frequent than expected [<xref rid="B196-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. The protective action of dietary fibers is attributed to their ability to dilute toxic environmental agents and to increase the intestinal tract transit, therefore leading to a reduced absorption at the intestinal level. Dietary fiber supplementation brings physical changes in microbiota composition [<xref rid="B195-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>], and these changes involve horizontal gene transfer either through transduction or bacterial conjugation. This bacterial genetic crosstalk, in turn, improves human health from a meta-genomic perspective [<xref rid="B195-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>].</p><p>Last but not least, probiotic therapy offers an interesting approach to stimulate host health via the transportation of anti-inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="B87-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The human gut microbiome is represented by a highly complex ecosystem of uncultured bacteria, responsible for the catabolism of dietary fibers that were not metabolized in the upper digestive tract due to a lack of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) [<xref rid="B92-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Studies identified 33 CAZymes encoding genes with a high homologous structure, from a meta-genomic dataset consisting of at least 20 individuals. Furthermore, 18 multigenic clusters encoding complementary enzymes responsible for plant cell wall digestion have also been identified [<xref rid="B92-medicina-55-00283" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec7-medicina-55-00283"><title>7. Conclusions and Further Perspectives</title><p>Despite the highly debatable role of natural compounds in combating cancer, these products are now emerging as important factors for cancer prevention or inhibition. Even if their activity is not necessarily directly correlated to the induction of cancer cell apoptosis, the intake of vitamins or other molecules from various food sources or synthesized drugs is starting to be more thoroughly investigated using next-gen technologies in oncology. Therefore, any deficiency in the previously mentioned nutrients has been correlated to a majority of cancers, and their genomic characterization can distinguish important information involving mechanisms and pathways. This complex biological effect can be deciphered using systems biology approaches, specifically evaluating the optimal dose of these micronutrients, in order to maximize the beneficial effects. <xref rid="medicina-55-00283-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes the impact that nutrients can have in cancer therapy, while the metabolism, including mechanism of action, of certain representative nutrients can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicina-55-00283-f002">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Considering the aforementioned facts, it is becoming clearer that one way to obtain optimal effects for health in general, and in cancer patients in particular, is to optimize diet for each individual, taking into account their metabolic requirements. As previously mentioned, this approach can be pursued through both nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics. By analyzing the potential genetic response of an individual to a set of nutrients, it will be possible to recommend an ideal treatment diet that synergistically works as an adjuvant in the inhibition of processes associated to specific malignancies. As time passes, it will become more about personalized nutrition and less about one-size-fits-all &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; diets; moreover, detailing the &#x0201c;good or bad&#x0201d; quantities of a certain nutrient. It should be remembered that diet alone cannot work in preventing or treating cancer, but should always be seen as an irremovable part of the whole array of molecular interactions that determine individual health. As presented in this review, there is a lot of accumulated data regarding nutrients yet to be analyzed and integrated into the bigger picture of personalized medicine. In addition, there is a dire need for an integrated multi-omic strategy incorporating nutrients and health, in order to obtain patient-specific beneficial outcomes concerning disease.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>A.I.I. and C.B. was responsible for the conceptualization of the study and manuscript writing, S.P. and L.M. was responsible for figure and introduction writing and <xref rid="medicina-55-00283-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizing the data; D.G., R.C., C.C. and A.O. were responsible for literature study.

The major impact of nutrients is through their action on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which has a critical role in tumor-promoting inflammation. Aside from this effect, nutrients have been shown to effect multiple hallmarks of cancer: for example, fatty acids act on tumor-promoting inflammation, the induction of angiogenesis, the activation of invasion and metastasis and the sustenance of proliferative signaling. Other effects can be observed, significantly impacting on a person&#x02019;s cancer susceptibility and prognosis, aspects of which can be modulated by patient diet in a directed manner, leading to the development of personalized nutrition.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medicina-55-00283-g001"/></fig><fig id="medicina-55-00283-f002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Pathways or interactions representative of the metabolism of nutrients.
