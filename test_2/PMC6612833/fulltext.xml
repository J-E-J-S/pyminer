For example, there exist methods for pseudo-time series analysis, differential cell usage, cell-type detection RNA-velocity in single cells, etc. Most analysis pipelines validate their results using known marker genes (which are not widely available for all types of analysis) and by using simulated data from gene-count-level simulators. Typically, the impact of using different read-alignment or unique molecular identifier (UMI) deduplication methods has not been widely explored.

These new technologies are rapidly evolving, and new assays are constantly being introduced. One of the most exciting and popular recent developments has been the creation of experimental protocols for assaying gene expression in thousands of individual cells (<xref rid="btz351-B11" ref-type="bibr">Hashimshony <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), allowing scientists to capture a snapshot of the dynamic and complex biological systems at work.</p><p>Individual cells are fundamental units of biological structures and functions, and understanding the dynamics of gene expression patterns is essential for understanding cell types, cell states and lineages. Single-cell gene expression studies have proven useful for unveiling rare cell types (<xref rid="btz351-B10" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#x000fc;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), abnormal cell states in the development of disease (<xref rid="btz351-B30" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell, 2015</xref>) and transcriptional stochasticity (<xref rid="btz351-B4" ref-type="bibr">Buganim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), by giving unprecedented insights into the dynamics of gene expression. Specifically, the accuracy, sensitivity and throughput of droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (dscRNA-seq) (<xref rid="btz351-B14" ref-type="bibr">Klein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B18" ref-type="bibr">Macosko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B38" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) has been particularly useful to scientists for understanding cellular dynamics through pseudo-time inference (<xref rid="btz351-B25" ref-type="bibr">Qiu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), estimation of splicing dynamics [i.e. RNA-velocity (<xref rid="btz351-B15" ref-type="bibr">La Manno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>)], population balance analysis (<xref rid="btz351-B14" ref-type="bibr">Klein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), spatial reconstruction to identify marker gene (<xref rid="btz351-B13" ref-type="bibr">Kiselev <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B27" ref-type="bibr">Satija <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and numerous other analyses.</p><p>Most computational dscRNA-seq analyses pipelines work in multiple phases, the first of which is the generation of a gene-by-cell count matrix from raw sequencing data. This process includes identifying and correcting cellular barcodes (CBs) (to determine properly captured cells), mapping and alignment of the sequencing reads to the reference genome or transcriptome, and the resolution of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to determine the number of distinct pre-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) molecules sequenced from each gene within each cell. Subsequent downstream analysis of the count matrix is then used for a variety of different purposes, such as lineage estimation, clustering and cell-type identification, identifying marker genes, estimating splicing rates, etc. Traditionally, gene-count matrices have been used as a fundamental unit of measurement for these analyses, and most research has been focused on developing new tools and improving methods for higher-level analyses [e.g. &#x0003e;90% of the tools described by <xref rid="btz351-B36" ref-type="bibr">Zappia <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)</xref> deal with post-quantification analyses]. Implicitly, these methods assume reliable and accurate input from the quantification phase.</p><p>Considerable research has been conducted into developing generative models of the gene-count matrices for a single-cell experiment, and producing synthetic count data with known true phenotypes or labels. Many models have been proposed to capture various characteristics of single-cell experiments; e.g. modeling zero inflation (<xref rid="btz351-B24" ref-type="bibr">Pierson and Yau, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B26" ref-type="bibr">Risso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), characterizing heterogeneity (<xref rid="btz351-B7" ref-type="bibr">Finak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and inferring dropout rates (<xref rid="btz351-B33" ref-type="bibr">Wei and Jingyi, 2018</xref>). Building upon this modeling work, a number of different simulation tools for single-cell RNA-seq data have been introduced. Count-level simulation tools such as Splatter (<xref rid="btz351-B35" ref-type="bibr">Zappia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and powersimR (<xref rid="btz351-B31" ref-type="bibr">Vieth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) use these generative models to directly simulate the gene-by-cell count matrices, and these simulators have been useful in developing and evaluating new methods for analyzing scRNA-seq data. However, that work has focused on simulating the gene-by-cell count matrices, rather than the raw sequencing reads that, when processed, give rise to this matrix. As such, these tools implicitly assume that the problem of estimating gene counts accurately from the raw sequencing data is relatively well-addressed. However, no principled tool is currently available for simulating the raw cell barcoded and UMI-tagged read sequences for validating and assessing the initial processing phases of dscRNA-seq analysis. In contrast, numerous tools and methods have been proposed (<xref rid="btz351-B8" ref-type="bibr">Frazee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B9" ref-type="bibr">Griebel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B16" ref-type="bibr">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) for read-level simulation of bulk-RNA-seq experiments. Although no simulation tool can perfectly recapitulate all of the characteristics and complexities of experimental data, these tools have been crucial in helping to drive the development of ever-more-accurate approaches for gene and transcript-level quantification from bulk-RNA-seq data.</p><p>In this paper, we present <italic>minnow</italic>, a comprehensive framework to generate read-level simulated data for dscRNA-seq experiments. <italic>Minnow</italic> accounts for many important aspects of tagged-end single-cell experiments, and models these effects at the sequence level. It models the process of UMI and CB tagging, molecular PCR amplification (including PCR errors and deviations from perfect efficiency), molecular fragmentation and sequencing. <italic>Minnow</italic> can generate synthetic sequencing reads that mimic other important aspects of experimental data, such as realistic degrees of gene-ambiguous sequencing fragments. Using the <italic>minnow</italic> simulation framework, we demonstrate how various dscRNA-seq quantification pipelines perform in generating gene-by-cell count matrices when validated on synthetic data with known ground truth. We describe and analyze the effect of modeling important characteristics of real experimental dscRNA-seq data, and show how sequence-level ambiguities like those present in real experimental dscRNA-seq data pose quantification challenges to existing pipelines.</p></sec><sec><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec><title>2.1 The <italic>minnow</italic> framework</title><p>For droplet-based protocols (<xref rid="btz351-B14" ref-type="bibr">Klein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B18" ref-type="bibr">Macosko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B38" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), mRNA molecules are attached to a CB and an UMI. After reverse transcription within a droplet, the barcoded, tagged-end complementary DNA (cDNA) undergoes amplification and fragmentation, followed by sequencing in a short read sequencing machine (illumina). Due to the small amount of biological material in each cell, such protocols typically undergo many cycles of PCR, making PCR sampling effects considerable and necessitating the use of UMIs to discard reads sequenced from duplicate molecules (those that derive from the same pre-PCR transcript). The sequence files generated by such protocols result in paired-end reads and have two core components. One end (typically read 1) of each read pair contains the concatenated nucleotide sequence of the CB and UMI, while the other end (typically read 2) is the cDNA representation of the mRNA molecule, usually as sequenced from the <inline-formula id="IE1"><mml:math id="IM1"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x02032;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> end (<xref rid="btz351-B38" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In essence, the scRNA-seq experiment is actually much like a single end RNA-seq protocol, where the CB contains the cell specific information and the UMI is used to identify PCR duplicates.</p><p>The core of <italic>minnow</italic> can be described as a composition of three steps; (i) selection of transcript, concordant with the target count matrix and properties of experimental data, for the initial pool of simulated molecules, (ii) simulation of CB and UMI tagging and (iii) simulation of PCR, fragmentation and sequencing. <italic>Minnow</italic> starts by consuming a gene-count matrix as input that provides the estimated number of distinct molecules within the sample corresponding to each gene within each cell. Then, based on a carefully chosen distribution of transcript isoforms, <italic>minnow</italic> distributes simulated molecules (transcripts) to each gene within each cell. Taking these as the initial biological pool of molecules to be sequenced, <italic>minnow</italic> then tags these molecules with cell barcodes and UMIs. Finally, it simulates the PCR, fragmentation and sequencing process. In general, since PCR is an exponential stochastic branching process, it generates more amplified molecules than reads obtained in a real experiment. We simulate the sequencing process by subsampling from the final amplified pool of PCR generated molecules to a sequencing depth specified by the user. During this generation process, we have tried to capture core attributes of single-cell RNA-seq at different levels, such as preserving the proportion of ambiguously mapped reads, simulating the PCR amplification bias, introducing sequence error using different error models, etc. It is important to note that <italic>minnow</italic> does not contain a generative model in itself, and depends on the matrix given as input. Therefore if a count matrix produced from a simple generative model is used, <italic>minnow</italic> will produce read sequences consistent with those counts while if an experimental count matrix is provided as input, artifacts such as doublets, empty droplets, etc. are likely to be reflected in the generated reads. While the development of a generative model that accounts for all of the nuances of experimental droplet-based scRNA-seq data are still an active area of research, <italic>minnow</italic> focuses, principally, on how to generate a realistic set of sequencing reads consistent with the provided count matrix. To the best of our knowledge at the time of writing this tool, <italic>minnow</italic> is the only comprehensive framework that simulates droplet-based scRNA-seq dataset at read level.</p><p>Presently, <italic>minnow</italic> focuses only on droplet-based single-cell protocols. So, for the rest of the paper, we refer to such datasets as scRNA-seq data. Following the general principle of common bulk-RNA-seq simulators (<xref rid="btz351-B8" ref-type="bibr">Frazee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B16" ref-type="bibr">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>), <italic>minnow</italic> follows a two-step process of simulation. If the experimental data (the raw <monospace><monospace>FASTQ</monospace></monospace> files) is provided, then we use <italic>alevin</italic> (<xref rid="btz351-B22" ref-type="bibr">Patro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B29" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) to obtain mapping and quantification results, and to learn a number of other auxiliary parameters that we use to generate a realistic simulation. To be specific, <italic>alevin</italic> generates a gene-by-cell count matrix, and other parameters, that <italic>minnow</italic> (invoked in <monospace>alevin-mode</monospace>) can directly consume. In the absence of a specific experimental dataset, <italic>minnow</italic> makes use of the <italic>Splatter</italic> (<xref rid="btz351-B35" ref-type="bibr">Zappia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) tool to generate a gene-by-cell count matrix (when invoked in <monospace>splatter-mode</monospace>). While in the present manuscript, we have considered the results related to <italic>Splatter</italic>, we note that <italic>minnow</italic> can be paired with any such method (<xref rid="btz351-B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) that realistically generates cell to gene-count matrix. Additionally, <italic>minnow</italic> accepts other attributes of a scRNA-seq experiment, starting from a set of pre-specified cell barcodes, UMIs, the number of per-cell molecules and cell-level cluster information. Subsequently, <italic>minnow</italic> generates the paired-end <monospace>FASTQ</monospace> files, along with the &#x02018;true&#x02019; gene-count matrix, cell names and gene names. The <monospace>FASTQ</monospace> files follow the common 10&#x000d7;-chromium (<xref rid="btz351-B38" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) (compatible with both versions 2 and 3) format, and can be consumed by any downstream tool capable of processing such files.</p><sec><title>2.1.1 Sampling from gene-count matrix</title><p>The main input to <italic>minnow</italic> is the gene-count matrix <inline-formula id="IE2"><mml:math id="IM2"><mml:mi mathvariant="script">M</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, where each element <italic>m<sub>ij</sub></italic> denotes the number of UMIs (either estimated or simulated by a count-level simulator) for gene <italic>g<sub>j</sub></italic> in cell <italic>i</italic>.

After this sampling step, <italic>minnow</italic> ends up with a <italic>ground truth</italic> gene-count matrix of integral counts that we denote as <inline-formula id="IE5"><mml:math id="IM5"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">T</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="script">M</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>
<italic>A major challenge</italic> for generating simulated sequences from gene counts is the lack of information about the transcript-level expression for a particular gene. Simulating the amplification and fragmentation of molecules and sequencing of fragments requires selecting which specific molecules (i.e. transcripts) contribute to the expression of each gene. Since most genes have multiple isoforms, which can share exons and vary widely in their sequence composition, there is no such thing as the canonical sequence at the level of a gene. However, the molecules selected for amplification, fragmentation and sequencing can have a tremendous impact on the specific characteristics of the simulated dataset (e.g. how many reads map ambiguously back to the genome, and the resulting difficulty of quantification). Full-length scRNA-seq protocols [such as SMART-seq (<xref rid="btz351-B23" ref-type="bibr">Picelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>)], aim to achieve uniform coverage over transcripts, meaning that numerous reads covering distinctive splice junctions are often sequenced, and transcript-level abundances can often be assessed (<xref rid="btz351-B1" ref-type="bibr">Arzalluz-Luque and Conesa, 2018</xref>). This means that bulk-RNA-seq simulators (<xref rid="btz351-B8" ref-type="bibr">Frazee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btz351-B16" ref-type="bibr">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>), though by no means a perfect match for such protocols, can plausibly be used for generating read-level simulated data. On the contrary, for tagged-end protocols, such frameworks do not seem to replicate the fundamental properties of real data (<xref rid="btz351-B34" ref-type="bibr">Westoby <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Minnow</italic> addresses this challenging problem in one of two ways, depending upon whether <inline-formula id="IE6"><mml:math id="IM6"><mml:mi mathvariant="script">M</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is an empirical estimate or a simulated count matrix. When the relevant parameters are trained from an experimental dataset, <italic>minnow</italic> follows an empirical estimation method to determine individual counts for candidate isoforms as described in Section 2.1.4. On the other hand, when the experimental data are not present (e.g. when using <italic>Splatter</italic> to generate <inline-formula id="IE7"><mml:math id="IM7"><mml:mi mathvariant="script">M</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), it uses previously estimated measures of sequence-level ambiguity from similar experiments in the same species. Alternatively, when neither of the above cases apply, <italic>minnow</italic> can optionally use a Weibull distribution, with a pre-specified shape parameter 0.44 and scale parameter 0.6 to determine the individual dominance of candidate isoforms [motivated by <xref rid="btz351-B12" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>2.1.2 Indexing inherent sequence ambiguity using read-length de Bruijn graphs</title><p>To replicate the gene-level ambiguity present in real scRNA-seq datasets (<xref rid="btz351-B29" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), <italic>minnow</italic> constructs an index that maps segments of the underlying transcriptome to the number of distinct transcripts (and genes) in which they occur. This allows selecting transcripts for amplification and fragmentation in a manner that will lead to realistic levels of ambiguity in the resulting simulated reads.</p><p>Specifically, <italic>minnow</italic> starts with a pre-constructed de Bruijn graph (<xref rid="btz351-B37" ref-type="bibr">Zerbino and Birney, 2008</xref>), with a <italic>k</italic>-mer size set to the read length, built over the reference transcriptome. The de Bruijn graph is commonly specified as a graph <inline-formula id="IE8"><mml:math id="IM8"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, built over the collection of <italic>k</italic>-mers (strings of length <italic>k</italic>) from an underlying set of sequences <italic>S</italic> (in the case of <italic>minnow</italic>, the set of transcripts), with an assumption that all members of <italic>S</italic> are at least of length <italic>k</italic>. Given a specified <italic>k</italic>, the set of vertices of <italic>G</italic> are <italic>k</italic>-mers from the members of <italic>S</italic>. An edge exists between two nodes of <italic>G</italic> if and only if there exists a <inline-formula id="IE9"><mml:math id="IM9"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>-mer in any of the underlying sequences of <italic>S</italic> containing both of these <italic>k</italic>-mers. Given such a representation, any sequence in <italic>S</italic> can be spelled out as a <italic>path</italic> in <italic>G</italic>.</p><p>Rather than the de Bruijn graph, <italic>minnow</italic> makes use of the compacted de Bruijn graph.

As shown in the recently introduced tool <italic>alevin</italic> (<xref rid="btz351-B29" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), accounting for gene-level ambiguity in the sequencing data can have important implications for the resulting quantification estimates. UMI graphs (<xref rid="btz351-B28" ref-type="bibr">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) or <bold>p</bold>arsimonious <bold>U</bold>MI <bold>g</bold>raphs (referring to the graphs as constructed by <italic>alevin</italic>, and which we denote as PUGs, details presented in Supplementary Section 1) (<xref rid="btz351-B29" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), succinctly encode most of the relevant characteristics of the experiment, while being much more concise than the set of raw reads. The construction of PUGs in <italic>alevin</italic> depends upon the structure of equivalence classes of transcripts and UMIs, which themselves depend upon the manner in which the UMI-tagged sequencing reads within a cell map to the underlying transcriptome [detail can be found in <xref rid="btz351-B29" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic> (2019)</xref>].</p><p>We use this intermediate structure to estimate the level of sequence ambiguity that is present in a particular experiment. We extract gene-level ambiguity information from the structure, and use it to help simulate fragments that simultaneously match the observed gene count and also display a realistic level of gene-level sequence ambiguity. Specifically, given a particular gene, we only look for equivalence classes from <italic>all</italic> cells that contain at least one transcript from that gene. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz351-F1">Figure&#x000a0;1b</xref>, we are interested in two quantities from such equivalence classes: (i) the equivalence class cardinality, i.e. the length of the set of transcripts and (ii) the equivalence class frequency, i.e. the number of reads that belong to that class. For an equivalence class <inline-formula id="IE32"><mml:math id="IM36"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">U</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, these are termed as <italic>label count</italic> [<inline-formula id="IE33"><mml:math id="IM37"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>len</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>] and <italic>read count</italic> [<inline-formula id="IE34"><mml:math id="IM38"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>freq</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>], respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz351-F1">Figure&#x000a0;1b</xref>. The label count signifies the degree of multimapping, and the read count captures the frequency of such multimapping. We note that both of these pieces of information are specific to a particular experiment. This transcript equivalence class level information about <italic>label count</italic> and <italic>read count</italic> can be transferred directly to the gene level. Given the gene <italic>g<sub>i</sub></italic>, we first single out the equivalence classes such that at least one of the transcripts in the equivalence class label belongs to <italic>g<sub>i</sub></italic>.

Another main component is the generation of CB and UMI sequences, properly affected by amplification and sequencing errors. In <italic>minnow</italic> we concentrated on mimicking the process as it occurs in 10&#x000d7; data, though the modular nature of the tool makes designing modules for other droplet-based protocols straightforward. The length of the CB and UMI sequences can be provided by the user, by default we follow 10&#x000d7; v2 protocol for generating the CB and UMI sequences. Given the number of unique molecules (present in the experiment) provided in terms of the gene-count matrix, and the randomly generated UMI sequences, we perform a random assignment between UMIs and molecules. Once generated, a complete unit of sequence that undergoes PCR consists of a concatenated string of CB, UMI and the corresponding reference molecule (i.e. transcript) as sampled from <inline-formula id="IE55"><mml:math id="IM59"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">U</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000b7;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2.2 PCR amplification and imputing sequence error</title><p>Once the set unique molecules are prepared, we simulate amplifying the molecules through multiple PCR cycles to generate a realistic distribution of PCR duplicates.

The PCR model in <italic>minnow</italic> can be described as a set of unbalanced probabilistic binary trees. The stochasticity of the model is determined by the probability of capture efficiency <italic>p</italic><sub>eff</sub> that can be externally set (default <italic>p</italic><sub>eff</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.98). At each cycle, with probability <italic>p</italic><sub>eff,</sub> molecules are chosen for duplication. In each duplication step, a nucleotide in the molecule is mutated with probability <italic>p</italic><sub>error</sub> (default <italic>p</italic><sub>error</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). At the end of simulating the PCR cycles, <italic>minnow</italic> randomly samples an appropriate number of molecules from the (duplicated) pool of molecules. Apart from providing this simple model, <italic>minnow</italic> also allows an optional flag to mimic the empirically supported model of PCR [described as Model 6 in Best <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)], where the efficiency of individual molecules is allowed to vary and is sampled from a normal distribution <inline-formula id="IE56"><mml:math id="IM60"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x003bc;</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x003c3;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (default values <inline-formula id="IE57"><mml:math id="IM61"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x003bc;</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.45</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x02009;</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x003c3;</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), and subsequently all the duplicated molecules inherit the efficiency from their parent. This step is highly stochastic, and can be customized to simulate PCR amplification given the uneven distribution of capture efficiency for individual molecules.

As discussed in Section 2.1.4, <italic>minnow</italic> utilizes the precise location of the unitig on the transcript from which the read is drawn. The unitig acts as a seed for sampling read sequences from the reference. Given a unitig <italic>u</italic>, with offset position <italic>p</italic> and length <italic>l</italic> on a transcript <italic>t</italic>, we resort to two different mechanisms for determining start position.

While it is highly recommended to use an empirically derived read start position distribution (which comes packaged with <italic>minnow</italic>), in absence of such quantity, <italic>minnow</italic> samples from a truncated normal distribution <inline-formula id="IE62"><mml:math id="IM66"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x003bc;</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x003c3;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> with <inline-formula id="IE63"><mml:math id="IM67"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x003bc;</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and a user defined <italic>&#x003c3;</italic> (default set to 10). The intuition behind using such a distribution is to simultaneously use the ambiguity information while avoiding sampling reads from the same exact region again and again. This variance in sampling is important, since fragmentation occurs after the majority of amplification in the protocols we are simulating, and so &#x02018;duplicate&#x02019; reads (reads from the same pre-PCR molecule) will tend to arise from different positions. Moreover, this framework creates an option for user to tune the <italic>&#x003c3;</italic> in order to move away from unitig dependent sampling. Upon selecting the sequence <italic>minnow</italic> can be instructed to impute sequencing error in the sampled sequence. <italic>Minnow</italic> can accept a variety of error model for substituting nucleotides, and follows the same format of error model as used in Frazee <italic>et al.</italic> (2015).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>3 Results</title><sec><title>3.1 Assessing quantification tools using <italic>minnow</italic></title><p>As its output, <italic>minnow</italic> produces the true abundance matrix <inline-formula id="IE64"><mml:math id="IM68"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">T</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="script">M</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, along with the raw <monospace>FASTQ</monospace> files containing the simulated reads. This enables rigorous testing of different quantification tools such as Cell-Ranger (<xref rid="btz351-B38" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), UMI-tools (<xref rid="btz351-B28" ref-type="bibr">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), etc. Hence, it is important to validate if the simulated reads generated by <italic>minnow</italic> are able to reproduce some of the challenges faced by these tools while consuming experimental data. One such factor that contributes to the performance of these tools is the mechanism by which they deduplicate UMI sequences (<xref rid="btz351-B29" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). We observe that when we stratify the genes with respect to their gene uniqueness, the divergence between different tools start to emerge. As a proof of concept, we have run the popular quantification tools Cell-Ranger (2.1.0 and 3.0.0) and UMI-tools on <italic>minnow</italic>-simulated data. The UMI-tools-based pipeline we used is a custom one, which uses STAR (<xref rid="btz351-B6" ref-type="bibr">Dobin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) for alignment, UMI-tools (<xref rid="btz351-B28" ref-type="bibr">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) for UMI resolution and featureCounts (<xref rid="btz351-B17" ref-type="bibr">Liao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) for deduplicated UMI counting&#x02014;we refer to this as the <italic>na&#x000ef;ve</italic> pipeline.</p><p>The estimated abundances are correlated (Spearman and Pearson) with the true gene count provided by <italic>minnow</italic>. We note that number of cells detected by a downstream tool varies from what is initially present in the raw <monospace>FASTQ</monospace> files. Therefore, while calculating a cell specific local correlations, we consider only the subset of the cells that are predicted by all tools.</p><p>
<italic>Minnow</italic> accepts a host of different input parameters, such as PCR-related mutation error, sequencing error, predefined custom error model for substitution, UMI pool size, number of PCR cycles, etc. As Cell-Ranger takes considerable time to finish (4&#x02013;6&#x02009;h for 4000 cells), we have limited ourselves to one run of 4&#x02009;K cells of all tools, demonstrating the variance of different tools in the data. We observe that <italic>minnow</italic> scales efficiently with increasing numbers of cells. That is, the bottleneck in our assessments was the time required by the quantification tools, as <italic>minnow</italic> can simulate millions of reads in a few minutes. Thus, for demonstrating other effects (e.g. how the choice of different degrees of sequence ambiguity in mapping Splatter-generated counts to specific genes affects quantification accuracy), we have limited our assessment to smaller simulated datasets consisting of 100 cells each. An assessment of the computational performance of <italic>minnow</italic> is provided in <xref rid="btz351-T2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>3.2 Datasets</title><p>We have used two different datasets for benchmarking. For a global analysis, in terms of downstream quantification accuracy, we have used the publicly available peripheral blood mononuclear cells dataset, referred to as pbmc 4k dataset (<xref rid="btz351-B38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>Zheng et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), obtained from the 10&#x000d7; website. As discussed in Section 2.1, we first used <italic>alevin</italic> to estimate the gene-count matrix and the relevant auxiliary parameters, such as the equivalence classes. The gene-count matrix along with the auxiliary files are then used as an input to <italic>minnow</italic>. <italic>Minnow</italic> is run with two different configurations. First, we consider the &#x02018;basic&#x02019; configuration, where no information other than the gene-count matrix from <italic>alevin</italic> is used. In the other configuration, referred to as &#x02018;realistic&#x02019;, we have made use of the equivalence classes produced by <italic>alevin</italic>, in addition to the compacted de Bruijn graph built on the transcript by TwoPaCo. The &#x02018;realistic&#x02019; configuration also used the empirical fragment length distribution. In both the cases, we have used normal mode for PCR with fixed capture efficiency.</p><p>The other datasets we used are generated by <italic>Splatter</italic> (<xref rid="btz351-B35" ref-type="bibr">Zappia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). <italic>Splatter</italic> accepts multiple parameters as input, including the generative model to use, the number of cells, the number of genes to express, etc. We used the splat model from <italic>Splatter</italic> to generate the gene-count matrix with default parameters. To manage the time consuming tools (Cell-Ranger-2 and 3), the analysis is restricted to 100 cells and 50&#x000a0;000 genes.</p></sec><sec><title>3.3 The presence of gene-level ambiguity drives the difficulty of UMI resolution and shapes the accuracy of downstream tools</title><p>With moderate numbers of fragments being sequenced per-cell and realistic diversity in the UMIs available to tag the initial molecules, existing pipelines appear to do a reasonable job of estimating the number of distinct molecules sampled from each gene within a cell. Yet, one major factor that appears to affect the accuracy of these different approaches is the level of sequence (specifically gene-level) ambiguity present in the simulated data. This is not particularly surprising, as neither Cell-Ranger (either version) nor the <italic>na&#x000ef;ve</italic> pipeline are capable of appropriately handling such situations (i.e. to where should an UMI be assigned if its corresponding read maps equally well between multiple genes?). However, understanding this effect seems important, as the degree of gene-ambiguous reads in a typical scRNA-seq ranges from <inline-formula id="IE65"><mml:math id="IM69"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x0223c;</mml:mo><mml:mn>13</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x02009;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>to</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02009;</mml:mo><mml:mn>23</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of the total reads (<xref rid="btz351-B29" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To study the effect of gene-level ambiguity on quantification pipelines, we have stratified the global correlation plot with respect to the <italic>uniqueness</italic> score of a gene. The uniqueness score is specified by the ratio of two quantities: number of <italic>k</italic>-mers unique to a gene (i.e. only appearing within transcripts of this gene) to the total number of distinct <italic>k</italic>-mers present in the gene. According to this metric, the most-unique gene will have a score of 1 and the least a score of 0. The stratified plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btz351-F2">Figs&#x000a0;2 and 3</xref>) demonstrates that in the &#x02018;basic&#x02019; simulation, the performance of all three tools are globally high. Interestingly, we note that Cell-Ranger-3 does slightly better than Cell-Ranger-2 (which in turn performs better than the <italic>na&#x000ef;ve</italic> pipeline) for non-unique genes, despite the fact that it does not have a specific mechanism for resolving such cases. On the other hand, in the &#x02018;realistic&#x02019; simulation, where gene-level sequence ambiguity was sampled to match the degree observed in <italic>even the most unique</italic> experimental data (this dataset exhibits <inline-formula id="IE66"><mml:math id="IM70"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x0223c;</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> gene-level multimapping meaning over 10% sequencing reads map to multiple genomic loci), the global performance decreased. One possible interpretation of such a considerable performance gap between different tools can be the specific method each method uses to categorize alignments [though all pipelines use STAR (<xref rid="btz351-B6" ref-type="bibr">Dobin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) as their aligner], as well as differences in the algorithms they use to resolve UMIs. It is clear, however, that failing to resolve the multimapped reads can have a detrimental effect the accuracy of all of the quantification pipelines. The performance gap is magnified when we increase the fraction of reads sampled from less-unique gene sequences. Thus, it should be noted that failing to model empirically observed levels of sequence ambiguity can result in the simulation of unrealistic sequenced fragments, that fail to capture important characteristics of real data, and where the variability of different tools are hard to spot. Thus, to create more realistic and representative simulated data, it appears to be important to carefully match the degree of gene-level multimapping observed in experimental data.

Therefore, while the distributional characteristics of the simulated counts are designed to accord with experimental data, there is no specific relationship between the generated counts and specific gene present in an organism. While this presents a challenge&#x02014;different mappings of simulated counts to different genes will result in different quantification performance&#x02014;it also presents a degree of freedom to explore how the performance of tools changes as we hold the counts fixed, but alter the mappings between counts and specific genes. We use this freedom to model extreme situations, and to explore the sensitivity of different quantification pipelines as we alter how counts are mapped to specific genes. Specifically, we considered three different scenarios. First, we use the gene uniqueness scores defined above to sort the set of genes in increasing order (from least to most unique). Then, we assign the gene with lowest uniqueness score to the highest expressed gene label (aggregated over all cells) from the <italic>Splatter</italic>-obtained matrix and so on. This biased allocation purposefully increases the challenge of resolution for downstream tools. We call this configuration &#x02018;adversarial&#x02019;. In the second configuration, we have selected a random set of genes and followed the &#x02018;realistic&#x02019; configuration by using the reference-based compacted de Bruijn graph and learned gene-level ambiguity distribution (as discussed in Section 2.1.2), following the same convention. We call this simulation &#x02018;realistic&#x02019;. Finally, the third configuration repeats the process of &#x02018;adversarial&#x02019; but in reverse order, i.e. assigning the most-unique gene to the most abundant gene label. This final configuration is a situation where we expect to see minimum level of ambiguously mapped reads, thereby making the quantification challenge relatively easy for all downstream tools. We call this configuration &#x02018;favorable&#x02019;.</p><p>
<xref rid="btz351-T1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the global correlation between three tools for all the above scenarios. We have also plotted (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) the distribution of these metrics for all 100 cells in the simulation, to show the shift in global mean in both spearman correlation and mean absolute relative differences (MARD). In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, we observe that for the &#x02018;adversarial&#x02019; data, the performance of all pipelines is considerably depressed. Conversely, for the &#x02018;favorable&#x02019; dataset (bottom row), the performance of all pipelines is considerably improved&#x02014;and the gap between the different versions of Cell-Ranger and the <italic>na&#x000ef;ve</italic> pipeline is reduced. The &#x02018;realistic&#x02019; simulation falls nicely between these two extremes, suggesting that, while not as pronounced as one observes in the &#x02018;adversarial&#x02019; scenario, the discarding of gene-ambiguous reads can have a considerable effect on quantification accuracy, even under realistic degrees of gene-level sequence ambiguity.</p><table-wrap id="btz351-T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Spearman correlation and MARD are calculated with respect to ground truth under three different configurations based on the same gene-count matrix produced by <italic>Splatter</italic></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="char" char="." span="1"/><col valign="top" align="char" char="." span="1"/><col valign="top" align="char" char="." span="1"/><col valign="top" align="char" char="." span="1"/><col valign="top" align="char" char="." span="1"/><col valign="top" align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Configuration</th><th colspan="3" rowspan="1">Correlation (Spearman)<hr/></th><th colspan="3" rowspan="1">MARD<hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">CR2</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">CR3</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">

First, it loads the gene-count matrix (as either a compressed binary or plain-text file) in a single thread. Then, it spawns multiple parallel threads (as many as specified by the user) to simulate reads deriving from different cells. This mechanism enables the most computationally intensive process (simulating PCR and generating read sequences) to happen independently and in parallel for each cell. This enables <italic>minnow</italic> to scale well with the number of threads when writing millions of reads to the disc.

Droplet-based assays, in particular, have proven very useful because of their high-throughput and ability to assay many cells. Driven by these exciting biotechnology developments, hosts of different methods have been developed in a relatively small time-frame to analyze the gene-by-cell count matrices that result from the initial quantification of these single-cell assay. Previously, various models have been proposed for simulating realistic count matrices (<xref rid="btz351-B35" ref-type="bibr">Zappia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). These approaches implicitly assume that, apart from some fundamental limitations due to the biotechnology (e.g. cell capture, molecule sampling from small finite populations, etc.), the problem of ascertaining accurate gene counts from raw sequencing data by aligning reads and deduplicating UMIs is essentially solved. Consequently, the effect of the failures of these quantification pipelines to produce accurate gene expression estimates is not accounted for in the assessment of downstream analysis methods using this simulated data.</p><p>In this paper, we introduced <italic>minnow</italic>, which covers an important gap in existing methods for single-cell RNA-seq simulation (<xref rid="btz351-B34" ref-type="bibr">Westoby <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>)&#x02014;the read-level simulation of sequencing data for droplet-based scRNA-seq assays. We demonstrate the use of <italic>minnow</italic> to assess the accuracy of the single-cell quantification methods under different configurations of sequence-level characteristics, ranging from adversarial, to realistic, to favorable. We propose a framework for the simulation of synthetic dscRNA-seq data, which simulates the CB, UMI and read sequences, while accounting for the considerable effects of PCR and realistic sequence ambiguity in generated reads. Further as a flexible framework <italic>minnow</italic> can be easily used to create a variety of possible configurations, such as changing fragment length distribution, sequencing error, collision rate, etc., to do robust testing of computational tools. We believe <italic>minnow</italic> will help the community to develop the next generation of quantification tools for droplet-based scRNA-seq data. It provides the first comprehensive framework to simulate such data at the sequence level, allowing users to validate the accuracy of different methods and providing useful feedback to determine future directions for improving quantification algorithms. <italic>Minnow</italic> is an open-source tool, developed in C++14, and is licensed under a BSD license.
