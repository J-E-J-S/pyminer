While profiling every sample under study would be advantageous, it is time-consuming and costly. Here we introduce Cell Population Mapping (CPM), a deconvolution algorithm in which the composition of cell types and states is inferred from the bulk transcriptome using reference scRNA-seq profiles ('<italic>scBio'</italic> CRAN R-package). Analysis of individual variations in lungs of influenza virus-infected mice, using CPM, revealed that the relationship between cell abundance and clinical symptoms is a cell-state-specific property that varies gradually along the continuum of cell-activation states. The gradual change was confirmed in subsequent experiments and was further explained by a mathematical model in which clinical outcomes relate to cell-state dynamics along the activation process. Our results demonstrate the power of CPM in reconstructing the continuous spectrum of cell states within heterogeneous tissues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a powerful approach to understanding the composition of different cell identities within a complex tissue, including discrete cell types, cell states that arise transiently during the progression of time-dependent processes, and continuous dynamic transitions within the space of possible cell states<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. The frequency of cell types and cell states may vary between genetically distinct individuals, environments, chemical perturbations, or disease states. To investigate this variation at high resolution, it is possible to generate scRNA-seq profiles for each sample of interest and then use it to evaluate the frequency of the different cell types and states<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. However, such studies are costly and time-consuming, and have therefore been performed only on a limited scale.</p><p id="P4">An alternative strategy would be to construct a comprehensive collection of reference scRNA-seq profiles representing various cell types and cell states. Deconvolution algorithms can then utilize those reference profiles to computationally predict the abundance of different cell types and states within a given sample, based on only the bulk expression data from that sample<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. This strategy should in principle avoid the scaling issues associated with multiple scRNA-seq experiments, but in practice, using a large number of reference profiles typically results in reduced prediction accuracy<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. A standard solution is to cluster the single-cell reference profiles into a relatively small number of cell-groups reference profiles<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. However, while this clustering-based approach may provide a rough quantification of discrete cell types and states, the continuous cell-state space remains sparse and fragmented. Therefore, there is a substantial need for a deconvolution methodology that can exploit the rich spectrum of single-cell reference profiles.</p><p id="P5">Here we propose the Cell Population Mapping (CPM) method, which provides an advantageous alternative to existing deconvolution approaches, particularly in providing a fine-resolution mapping. Similarly to recent studies<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, CPM constructs its reference collection from scRNA-seq profiles derived from one or a few relevant samples, and then exploits this collection to infer cell composition within additional, bulk-profiled samples. However, instead of focusing on quantifying a few dozens of discrete cell subtypes, CPM analyses thousands of single-cell profiles scattered across the wide landscape of cell states. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that deconvolution with CPM significantly improves the quantification of both gradual and abrupt changes in cell abundance over the continuous space of cell types and states. Furthermore, by analyzing complex changes in lung tissues, across influenza virus-infected mice of various genetic backgrounds, we demonstrated the effectiveness of CPM in probing phenotypic diversity in large cohorts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Overview of CPM</title><p id="P6">We developed CPM, a method based on computational deconvolution for identifying a cell population map from bulk gene expression data of a heterogeneous sample. In our framework, the cell population map is the abundance of cells over a cell-state space. Whereas the biological definition of a cell type refers to the core characteristics of a cell, a cell state can be thought of as the current phenotype in which a given cell type can be found (e.g., various proliferation, activation and differentiation states)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The cell-state space specifies each cell state as a point in a multi-dimensional space; as cells undergo changes from one state to another, they travel through the space along a trajectory between these two states<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Unlike existing computational methods that are focused on reconstruction of the cell-state space from scRNA-seq data<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, CPM takes as its input the previously-reconstructed cell state space of a certain scRNA-seq data, and then relies on this input to infer the abundance of each point in this space within a given bulk cell population.</p><p id="P7">Formally, CPM relies on two input types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>): first, a bulk expression profile of the heterogeneous cell population, and second, scRNA-seq profiles of individual single cells derived from one or a few representative samples ('reference data'). We assume that the cell-state space of the reference cells is given as input and that the particular position of each reference single cell within this space is known. The cell-state space is typically obtained by dimension-reduction (such as t-SNE<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) that capture the essence of gene-regulation variation among the reference single cells (exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> top). It is also possible to use a well-defined trajectory within this space as an alternative "one-dimensional space"; such trajectory can explicitly describe the progression of cells through a biological process (exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> bottom).</p><p id="P8">CPM consists of two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>): (i) Applying a deconvolution approach [here, support vector regression (SVR) approach], which combines the bulk profile of a complex tissue with a collection of reference scRNA-seq profiles to infer the composition of cells within the complex tissue input. The output of this step is the abundance of cells at the sub-region of each reference single cell. Such prediction poses two substantial challenges: first, an accuracy problem in deconvolving a very large number of reference profiles (typically, the analysis may involve thousands of single cells<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and secondly, a potential bias owing to the non-uniform distribution of reference cells over the cell-state space. To address these challenges, CPM applies deconvolution using a relatively small subset of reference profiles, which are obtained by an unbiased random sampling to ensure that every region in the cell space has an equal chance of being sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The sampling and deconvolution procedures are repeated <italic>N</italic> times (here, <italic>N</italic> = 1,500), and the results are aggregated and averaged into a single inferred abundance for each reference single cell. (ii) From the inferred cell abundance in each particular reference coordinate, CPM extrapolates the cell abundance in any other cell-state coordinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In this extrapolation it is assumed that the shape of the cell distribution over the cell-state space is continuous and smooth. We refer to this smoothed continuous output as the 'cell population map'. Notably, CPM may use input bulk data either as a relative profile (i.e., response between two samples) or as an absolute (single-sample) profile, thereby predicting relative or absolute cell-state abundance, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Performance analysis</title><p id="P9">We used a simulation framework to measure the ability of CPM to predict the cell population map at fine resolution. The simulation was based on a collection of 1860 reference scRNA-seq profiles<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> taken from murine lungs during influenza virus infection and encompassing nine major immune and non-immune cell types: fibroblasts, epithelial cells, blood and lymphatic endothelial cells, T cells, B cells, NK cells, granulocytes, and cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), encompassing monocytes (MO), macrophages (M&#x003a6;s) and dendritic cells. In this reference dataset, one well-characterized trajectory is the gradual transition of cell states (within each cell type) from resting (naive)-like cells into active cells that respond to the influenza virus infection<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Synthetic bulk profiles of a complex tissue were created by mixing these single-cell profiles according to predetermined biologically-relevant functions over the cell-state space, introducing noise in the expression of genes and in the coordinates of single cells (denoted 'expression noise' and 'cell space noise', respectively). The quality of this strategy is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref> and further discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>. CPM was compared to three alternative deconvolution methods - DCQ<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, Cibersort<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and standard SVR<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> - whose reference collection was the "averaged" profiles of single-cell groups (the larger the number of such single-cell groups, the higher the 'granularity' analyzed by the alternative methods; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>). The 'accuracy' of predictions was evaluated by comparing the ground-truth cell abundance to the predicted abundance of each reference single cell.</p><p id="P10">To analyze performance, we focused on three fundamental types of simulations: (i) The 'cell-type simulation', in which cell abundance varies from one cell type to another, but within each cell type, the abundance is uniformly distributed over the cell-state space; (ii) the 'cell-subtype simulation', consisting of a modified abundance of a subpopulation of cell states within selected cell types; and (iii) the 'gradual-change simulation', representing continuous alterations of cell abundance along the trajectory of cell activation states (within selected cell types) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Overall, whereas the cell-type simulation is focused on inter-cell-type variation, the cell-subtype and gradual-change simulations are focused on intra-cell-type variation, which arises from differences among cell states within the same cell type.</p><p id="P11">Consistent with previous observations, changes in discrete cell types were accurately modelled by the alternative deconvolution methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). However, in the case of intra-cell-type changes in the composition of cell states (the 'cell-subtype' and 'gradual-change' simulations), CPM showed consistent improvement in prediction accuracy compared to existing deconvolution methods (relative bulk data: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2CD</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2AB</xref>; absolute bulk data: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3AB</xref>) within a reasonable running time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2CD</xref>). Unsurprisingly, CPM was able to capture the continuous nature of the input tissue, unlike the alternative deconvolution methods that could provide only a discrete approximation with lower accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figs. 2E, 3C</xref>). Furthermore, CPM outperformed the existing methods in its ability to handle a high cell-state complexity and in its 'scalability' to a large number of reference profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2FG</xref>, detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). Quantitatively similar results were also observed for varying parameter settings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), using different cell-state space solutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>), and for regions of different local density within the cell-state space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 5BC</xref>). Of note, CPM may lose power with lower sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Relationships between infection symptoms and cell abundance are a cell-state-specific property</title><p id="P12">We applied CPM to investigate <italic>in-vivo</italic> influenza virus infection across the Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred strains<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, a panel of mouse lines designed to mimic the phenotypic and genotypic diversity seen in human populations. To this end, we generated bulk transcriptional expression profiles derived from lung tissues of 38 infected and 34 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control mice (typically one or two individuals of each CC strain; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>). We transformed absolute bulk profiles into relative bulk profiles using a common control profile as the normalizer, and then applied CPM to each of these bulk profiles using the abovementioned single-cell measurements of the same experimental setting (lung tissues from influenza virus-infected mice<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) as the reference data. As the cell-state space, CPM utilized the continuous sequence of cell-activation states that were previously defined for each of the nine immune and non-immune cell types in this reference dataset<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Altogether, CPM calculated a relative cell population map consisting of relative cell abundance in each cell state for each individual mouse. We found that CPM predictions varied considerably between individuals (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and that this variation was robust across the <italic>N</italic> deconvolution repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">While the inferred cell population maps demonstrated substantial variation, the extent to which these cell-state changes relate to the clinical outcome of disease remained unclear. To elucidate this point, we monitored one of the main clinical symptoms of murine infection, namely the body weight loss (measured at 2 days post-infection (p.i.); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), and calculated the correlation (across individuals) between this outcome and the inferred relative abundance of each reference cell (denoted the 'cell-to-phenotype correlation'). By splitting the reference cells into consecutive activation-state intervals (within each cell type) we could assess the variation in cell-to-phenotype correlations over the activation trajectory (illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig.7B</xref>). Intriguingly, cell-to-phenotype correlations across infected mice clearly manifested a gradual increase over the trajectory of cell-activation states, ranging from negative correlations at the lower (naive-like) range toward positive correlations at the upper (activated) range (mainly in T cells, MPS and fibroblasts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). In fact, no particular threshold could be found that splits the activation-state trajectory into two discrete groups in which cell-to-phenotype correlations did not gradually change. Similar conclusions about the gradual change in cell-to-phenotype correlations were obtained using a second public dataset of influenza virus infection<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and using additional computational analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 7C-H</xref>). As expected, the use of unrelated (uninfected) reference datasets and alternative deconvolution methods did not yield the same conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 7IJ</xref>). Taken together, these findings highlight the advantage of a CPM model that is based on a continuous space of cell states, and further emphasize the importance of using reference and bulk data derived from a similar experimental setting.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Experimental validation of predictions</title><p id="P14">To test for the presence of a gradual change in cell-to-phenotype relationships as predicted by CPM, we performed flow cytometry analyses of lung cells from influenza-infected CC mice at 2 days p.i. We focused on MO/M&#x003a6; cell types, which constitute a major fraction of the total MPS population. To determine the activation states of MO/M&#x003a6;s we used flow cytometry with two established cell-activation markers, CD64 and Ly6C<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. The use of these markers enabled us to quantify the distribution of cells over a trajectory of activation states ranging from non-inflammatory (CD64<sup>low</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup>) to inflammatory (CD64<sup>high</sup>Ly6C<sup>high</sup>) MO/M&#x003a6;s. As expected, the fraction of inflammatory MO/M&#x003a6;s was higher in infected mice than in PBS-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4AB</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Encouraged by this observation we then used the flow cytometry measurements to calculate cell-to-phenotype correlation, i.e., the correlation between the clinical readout (weight loss at 2 days p.i.) and the MO/M&#x003a6; cell fractions enumerated by flow cytometry across infected individuals. The correlation analysis yielded several lines of evidence that validated the reconstruction by CPM: (i) inflammatory MO/M&#x003a6;s showed a positive cell-to-phenotype correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.67, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> left); (ii) non-inflammatory MO/M&#x003a6;s had a negative cell-to-phenotype correlation (r<sup>2</sup>=&#x02212;0.54, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> right); (iii) cell-to-phenotype correlations increased with each of the two separate activation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>); and (iv) flow cytometry analysis confirmed a gradual increase in correlation values over the CD64-cell-state continuum for both Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). The lack of cell-to-phenotype correlation obtained when we used the total MO/M&#x003a6;s count (r<sup>2</sup>=0.1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8A</xref>) further validated the contention that cell-to-phenotype relationships depend on particular cell-activation states, thus accentuating the importance of fine-resolution deconvolution mapping. Whereas the observed association between activated-inflammatory MO/M&#x003a6;s and severe physiological responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> left) has been previously reported<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, the opposite trend of naive MO/M&#x003a6;s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> right) and the continuous transition between negative and positive correlations over the activation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>) have not been previously described.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Inferring dynamics with a Markov model</title><p id="P15">Given that the CPM-reconstructed map yielded accurate predictions for MPS cells, we next investigated the temporal dynamics over the activation trajectory for these cells. Our results showed that the association between cell abundance and weight loss varies in a gradual manner along the MPS-activation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), but that the total MPS counts did not correlate with the body weight loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8A</xref>). A parsimonious explanation for this observation is that the phenotypic diversity is associated with inter-individual variation in temporal dynamics along the activation process; for example, inter-individual variation in onset times, or in cell-state progression rates. Like scRNA-seq data<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, the CPM-reconstructed data provided valuable information that allowed such temporal dynamics to be computationally reconstructed. For instance, we focused here on cell-state progression, and since its underlying mechanism is a stochastic process, we assumed a Markov process of naive-to-activation transitions between consecutive cell states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>). We used this model to predict the probability of transition ('transition rate') between sequential states in each individual mouse (see examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8C</xref>). With the assumption that the activation-onset time in all individuals is the same, comparison of the inferred transition rates might reveal complex transition-rate-to-phenotype relationships (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8D</xref>). By calculating transition rates based on CPM predictions, we found that weight loss is indeed positively correlated with transition rates over a wide range of the MPS activation axis (at its early and intermediate parts; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8E</xref>). These CPM-predicted transition rates closely matched the rates calculated from flow cytometry measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8EF</xref>). Overall, this theoretical approach suggests a mechanistic model of <italic>in-vivo</italic> influenza-outcome diversity and demonstrates a general strategy for uncovering inter-individual variation in temporal dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Now that the ability to generate scRNA-seq data of multiple experiments exists, it should become possible to gain a detailed understanding of variations in cellular heterogeneity that correlate with clinical and molecular factors<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. However, such analyses will continue to pose substantial challenges: generation of scRNA-seq measurements across multiple experiments is time-consuming, costly and requires expertise in single-cell technologies. In addition, fine-resolution deconvolution using a large repertoire of cell states is not readily available due to a trade-off between tissue-complexity and scalability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2F</xref>). CPM tackles this challenge by allowing reconstruction of cellular heterogeneity at fine resolution in many bulk-profiled samples, relying on reference single-cell data from only one or a few representative samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Using synthetic data we showed here that although changes in the quantity of a discrete cell population are accurately modelled by existing deconvolution methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), CPM outperforms these methods in accurately mapping the continuous spectrum of cell states within discrete cell types (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2CD</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We further demonstrated the power of CPM by using complex clinical and genomics data derived from <italic>in-vivo</italic> infections of genetically-diverse mice. First, CPM successfully recapitulated the previously reported<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> positive cell-to-phenotype correlations in the high-activation range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3C</xref>).

Experimental validation of MO/M&#x003a6; cells supported these gradual changes from negative to positive correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-E</xref>), demonstrating that CPM-inferred cell-state-specific quantities can provide valuable information needed for modelling phenotypic diversity in large cohorts.</p><p id="P18">We believe that CPM is likely to prove useful for additional analysis, such as calculations of cell-state-specific expression within complex tissues<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, reconstruction of temporal dynamics of cell-state progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>), and studying cellular heterogeneity within the massive body of existing bulk genomics data such as TCGA<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and GTeX<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Furthermore, as extensive single-cell catalogues (e.g. the Human Cell Atlas<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) are currently constructed, it may soon become possible to analyze cellular heterogeneity in bulk expression data without requiring expertise in single-cell technologies (discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S9" specific-use="web-only"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>The CPM algorithm</title><p id="P19">CPM takes as input both bulk transcriptome and reference data. The input bulk transcriptome is represented in a column vector of expression values across all genes. Bulk expression values can be either the measured expression values in a single heterogeneous tissue or the relative values between two experiments, such as disease vs. healthy heterogeneous tissues. The input reference data consists of scRNA-seq profiles, represented in a matrix of the format <italic>R<sub>ij</sub></italic> where the <italic>ij</italic>-th entry is the expression levels of gene <italic>j</italic> in single cell <italic>i</italic>. A row vector <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic> in this matrix is a RNA-seq signature of a certain reference single cell <italic>i</italic> (referred to as a 'reference profile'). We further assume that the main split of cells into broad cell type categories is known, and that low quality cells were already removed<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Additionally, we assume that each cell type is associated with a pre-determined neighborhood structure, denoted the 'cell-state space' structure. The cell-state space is represented as a set of coordinates where the <italic>i</italic>-th entry represents the position of reference single cell <italic>i</italic> within the cell-state space. The cell space should be constructed in a pre-processing step through various single-cell analysis techniques. For instance, it is possible to exploit standard dimension reduction methods that provide cell positions in a low dimensionality space (such as t-SNE or using several principle components<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible to determine the position of cells along a certain trajectory of cell states and utilize this trajectory as a 1-dimensional cell-state space<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p id="P20">CPM starts with a preprocessing step in which genes carrying many dropout events (here, fraction of zero expression values across single cells &#x0003e; 90%) are filtered. Both the reference profiles and the input bulk profile are then standardized. Next, the algorithm proceeds in two steps: first, infer the level of the reference cells within the complex tissue, and then use this information to predict cell abundance over the entire continuous cell-state space.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Step 1 (deconvolution)</title><p id="P21">To infer the abundance level of the reference cells in a bulk expression profile, we solve the following linear regression: <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:munder><mml:mo>&#x02211;</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle><mml:mo>&#x022c5;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic> is the expression vector of all genes in reference single cell <italic>i</italic>, <italic>U</italic> is the vector of expression levels of all genes in the complex tissue, and &#x003b2;<sub>i</sub> indicates the unknown abundance of single cell <italic>i</italic> in the complex tissue. As in Cibersort<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, we achieve robustness by solving this regression using linear SVR (the "LiblineaR" R package<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) to prevent biases due to outliers. To further improve performance in the presence of a large number of reference profiles, we use a consensus approach, in which the abovementioned SVR inference is repeated <italic>N</italic> times for <italic>N</italic> different subsets of the reference profiles (denoted 'reference subsets'), each reference subset consists of <italic>Ns</italic> profiles. Predicted abundance values of the <italic>N</italic> runs are then averaged for each individual reference cell.</p><p id="P22">We apply several improvements that make step 1 more robust and accurate. First, we perform an unbiased random selection of the reference subset (without replacements) so that the selected subset is uniformly distributed over the cell-state space. To address this, each reference cell is sampled by random sampling of a 'pivot point' within the cell-state space using inverse transform sampling and then choosing an arbitrary reference cell in the proximity of this pivot point. A grid was added to the cell-state space so that all reference cells that fall in a certain entry of this grid are defined as the proximity group for a pivot that falls in this entry. The number of grid-entries, calculated on each cell type separately, is the number of reference single cells divided by the cell neighborhood size. <italic>N</italic> was set to a value in which each reference cell would be selected to an average depth of at least <italic>Nr</italic> repeats. In particular, given that cells in high-density grid-entries are less likely to be selected, we calculate <italic>N</italic> based on the highest-density entry by requiring that each cell in this entry would be selected to an average depth of <italic>Nr</italic> repeats.</p><p id="P23">The second improvement is that each SVR run is applied on a set of genes that is tailored for a specific reference subset. The basic idea is to select a gene set that offers the best ability to distinguish between the reference profiles. Similarly to Cibersort<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, for each gene we compare its expression in different scRNA-seq profiles using one-way ANOVA (the <italic>Nd</italic> nearest neighbors of each cells are used to calculate the within-group variance component); each gene is then associated with the cell profile in which it attains the highest average expression, and the <italic>Ng</italic> top ANOVA-score genes associated with each cell profile are selected. In particular, <italic>Ng</italic> is defined as the number that minimizes the 'condition number' that is calculated with the R 'kappa' function.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Step 2 (extrapolation)</title><p id="P24">To infer the abundance of a given candidate cell state, CPM averages the predicted abundances of its <italic>Nd</italic> nearest-neighbor reference cells. This leads to a smoothed cell abundance over the entire cell-state space. We refer to this solution as the 'cell population map'.</p><p id="P25">Overall, the methodology relies on three parameters: the number of deconvolution repeats (determined by <italic>Nr</italic>), the reference subset size (<italic>Ns</italic>) and the cell neighborhood size (<italic>Nd</italic>). Here we used <italic>Nr</italic>=5, <italic>Ns=</italic>50 and <italic>Nd=</italic>10 as our default setting.

As previously reported<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, this collection already excludes poor-quality cells, and the cells were already partitioned into nine cell-type groups (in total, 92 B cells, 135 blood endothelial cells, 24 epithelial cells, 291 granulocytes (GN), 345 lymphatic endothelial cells, 375 fibroblasts, 103 mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) cells, 117 natural killers (NK) cells and 378 T cells). Furthermore, it was previously defined, for each of the nine immune and non-immune cell type, the progression of cell states through a trajectory of an antiviral-activation response<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. We refer to this continuum as the 'trajectory' of cell activation states. Briefly, the cell-state trajectory was constructed in two steps: first, a group of 101 generic-response genes were defined (consisting of all genes that were upregulated in all nine cell types during influenza infection); next, for each single cell, its average expression level across these generic genes was used as the activation-state trajectory<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3AC</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4DE</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figs. 7C-G,I,J</xref>, this trajectory was further binned into equal intervals.

We generated both absolute and relative synthetic bulk profiles and in both cases tested the entire range of noise parameter (ranging from an entirely non-informative data to an almost-zero noise). The 'accuracy' was calculated as the Pearson correlation between the actual and predicted fractions of cells.

CPM algorithm.</title><p>A flowchart of the CPM pipeline (<bold>A</bold>) with illustrations of specific steps (<bold>B</bold>-<bold>D</bold>). The prior (reference) knowledge consists of single-cell RNA-seq profiles (derived from one or a few individuals) together with their associated cell-state space structure (A, top); such space may be constructed either through dimension reduction (e.g., a two-dimensional space in B, top) or through further identification of a well-defined cell trajectory (e.g., a "one-dimensional space" in B, bottom). Given a bulk expression profile of a complex tissue, CPM utilizes a deconvolution approach to infer the quantity of each reference cell (A middle, C) and then extrapolates these predictions over the entire cell-state space, thereby providing the output 'cell population map' (A bottom, D). To avoid simultaneous deconvolution with a very large number of reference profiles, deconvolution is applied <italic>N</italic> times on subsets of the reference profiles, and the inferred quantities are then aggregated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="emss-81815-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Performance assessed via synthetic data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Synthetic data were generated either by changes of cell percentage in discrete cell types ('cell-type simulation', top); by changes of cell percentage in cell subtypes, within cell types ('cell-subtype simulation', middle); or by gradual changes in cell percentage along a trajectory of cell states ('gradual-change simulation', bottom).
