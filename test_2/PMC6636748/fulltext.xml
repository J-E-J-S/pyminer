successful at increasing our knowledge of molecularly characterized diseases. Given a set of disease genes associated with a disease, neighbourhood-based methods and random walkers exploit the interactome allowing the prediction of further genes for that disease. In general, however, diseases with no known molecular basis constitute a challenge. Here we present a novel network approach to prioritize gene-disease associations that is able to also predict genes for diseases with no known molecular basis. Our method, which we have called Cardigan (ChARting DIsease Gene AssociatioNs), uses semi-supervised learning and exploits a measure of similarity between disease phenotypes. We evaluated its performance at predicting genes for both molecularly characterized and uncharacterized diseases in OMIM, using both weighted and binary interactomes, and compared it with state-of-the-art methods. Our tests, which use datasets collected at different points in time to replicate the dynamics of the disease gene discovery process, prove that Cardigan is able to accurately predict disease genes for molecularly uncharacterized diseases. Additionally, standard leave-one-out cross validation tests show how our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods at predicting genes for molecularly characterized diseases by 14%-65%. Cardigan can also be used for disease module prediction, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 87%-299%.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The elucidation of the genetic causes of diseases is central to understanding the mechanisms of action of a pathology and the development of treatments. Disease gene prediction methods streamline the discovery of the molecular basis for a disease by prioritizing genes for experimental validation. Although some methods use disease phenotype to aid the prioritization, the great majority use outdated static matrices which limits their disease coverage. Our approach uses an updatable disease phenotype similarity, and employs a non-linear transformation to define a prior probability distribution over the genes that mimics the distribution of disease genes in the interactome. Subsequently, a semi-supervised learning method establishes a prioritization ordering for all genes in the interactome, even for diseases with no known molecular basis. Our method can be used not only to obtain a better prioritization for disease-gene associations, but also for retrieving disease modules.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/K004131/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8059-1346</contrib-id><name><surname>Paccanaro</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/F00964X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8059-1346</contrib-id><name><surname>Paccanaro</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M025047/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8059-1346</contrib-id><name><surname>Paccanaro</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a (PY)</institution></funding-source><award-id>14-INV-088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8059-1346</contrib-id><name><surname>Paccanaro</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a (PY)</institution></funding-source><award-id>PINV15-315</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8059-1346</contrib-id><name><surname>Paccanaro</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1660648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8059-1346</contrib-id><name><surname>Paccanaro</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The work is supported in part by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), grants BB/K004131/1, BB/F00964X/1 and BB/M025047/1 and NSF Advances in Bio Informatics grant 1660648 to A.P., CONACYT Paraguay Grants 14-INV-088 and PINV15-315.

Despite this growth, the mechanisms of action through which genomic variants drive disease development are not fully understood. As genomic alleles and malignant mutations are continuously sequenced, most of them still miss a functional annotation [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Early approaches to find non-experimental disease gene associations were based on linkage analysis, which establishes likelihood of observing alleles in an organism compared to random chance [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, this type of analysis is highly dependent on linkage disequilibrium, and thus traditionally fails on genetically multifactorial and heterogeneous diseases [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Alternative approaches, such as genome-wide association studies, do find gene candidates even for complex diseases. However, they often produce hundreds of candidates, making experimental validation expensive and time consuming.</p><p>Recent network medicine based approaches bypass the lack of functional annotation by drawing inferences from interaction data. Diseases are seen as perturbations in specific areas of the interactome &#x02013; the disease modules. Thus the guilt-by-association [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] principle can be applied to find disease genes by prioritizing those close to already known ones. Several approaches have been proposed that exploit this idea and they differ in how they quantify the distance between candidate genes and known disease genes in the interactome. Common measures for the proximity are the number of direct connections, the length of shortest paths and diffusion kernels, including random walkers with restart and propagation flow. For example, Oti <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] use direct neighbours, K&#x000f6;hler <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] use random walkers with restart, and Navlakha <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] include propagation flow and clustering techniques.</p><p>Previous authors have also shown that diseases with overlapping modules present significant similarities in terms of phenotype and occurrence (comorbidity) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Phenotypic data has been suggested to be particularly informative as different perturbations in a single disease module often produce similar phenotypes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and phenome networks (where genes are nodes that are connected if they show correlated phenotypic profiles) strongly correlate with protein-protein interactions and transcriptional regulatory networks [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, diseases found in distant neighborhoods in the interactome produce different phenotypes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several methods have been proposed that combine these different types of data to predict disease genes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One group of methods integrates the data into a unique graph that is then used for the prediction. Lage <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] include disease phenotype in the form of clinical features extracted by text mining from scientific papers; Wu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] create binary networks where nodes represent genes, and these are connected when their BLAST E-values is higher than a predefined threshold; Chen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] include information from the Gene Ontology [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the Mammalian Phenotype [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and various types of pathway annotations; Li <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Vanunu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Mordelet <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] include the van Driel disease similarity information [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to enhance the network; and other authors use heterogeneous networks where nodes can be either diseases or genes &#x02013; Xie <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] connect the nodes with Online Mendelian Disease in Man (OMIM) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and MGI mouse phenotype-gene associations, and Zeng et al [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] use HeteSim [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] scores. Another group of methods carries out inferences for each different type of data separately, and then integrate the results. In particular, Aerts <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] use co-expression networks, metabolic pathways, Gene Ontology, among others; Franke <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] include the Gene Ontology and co-expression networks; Radivojac <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] use the Gene Ontology, the Disease Ontology [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and features based on protein sequence; Karni <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] use disease based co-expression networks; and George <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] use metabolic pathways and Pfams [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Similar techniques have been used on a related problem, that of predicting disease modules &#x02013; disease genes can then be found within members of these modules. Liu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] recover disease modules through the analysis of gene expression data and partitions of co-expression networks; Ghiassian <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] use direct neighbour analysis on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to iteratively add genes to the modules.</p><p>All these network methods produce high quality results, but require initial seeds (i.e. a few known disease genes) to produce their predictions. In general, results are better when more seeds are available, and several authors have employed disease families (rather than single diseases) which were obtained by aggregating phenotypically similar diseases [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], thus increasing the number of initial seeds for their predictions.</p><p>An important point to be made here is that there are many molecularly uncharacterized diseases, for which no disease gene is currently known &#x02013; as of 2018 these comprise 3359 diseases in OMIM, i.e. 39% of the entire OMIM database. For these diseases, most of the methods described earlier are not applicable since the initial seeds are not available (notable exceptions are PRINCE [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and ProDiGe4 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], described in the <italic>Methods</italic> section).

Our approach, which we have called Cardigan (ChARting DIsease Gene AssociatioNs), is based on a semi-supervised algorithm that propagates labels on the interactome. These labels integrate disease phenotypic information expressed as a similarity measure between diseases, which is obtained by mining and comparing sets of MeSH terms [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] relevant for the diseases. The approach can be thought of as establishing the location for the modules of charted diseases and using these to &#x0201c;triangulate&#x0201d; the location of the modules of uncharted diseases by exploiting disease phenotypic similarities &#x02013; the intuition for the approach is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007078.g001">Fig 1</xref>.

Also note that the importance of the difference between <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> is proportional to the edge weight (<italic>W</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>), i.e. it is related to the probability of the interaction. At the same time, the role of the second term is to conserve the initial labels (QWS), thus it emphasizes the reliability of the initial data for the prediction&#x02013;this term is minimized when the nodes labels <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> are the same as the initial labels <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>.

To verify this, we checked whether its highest ranking genes share functions and whether they tend to be located in the same neighborhood in the interactome. Our analysis shows that genes with higher weights in the QWS for the different diseases are more likely to share function than expected by random, and that the top genes tend to be located in the same neighborhood (detailed description of this analysis is presented in Section <italic>Analysis of modular properties of gene sets</italic> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007078.s003">S1 Text</xref>).</p><p>Our method differs from earlier kernel methods approaches for scoring disease genes such as, for example, the Lippert <italic>et al</italic>. method [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] which requires a clear distinction between known diseases genes, which are labeled, and other genes, which are unlabeled (more details are provided in Section <italic>Relation between Cardigan and the Lippert method</italic> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007078.s003">S1 Text</xref>). In fact, an important difference between Cardigan and other well-known kernelized scoring methods lies in the use of initial labeling for genes other than the known disease genes. Finally, we point out that by including the initial labels, our methodology can be incorporated in a generalized framework, such as, for example, the RANKS tool from Valentini <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (a detailed explanation for RANKS is provided in Section <italic>Generalization of Cardigan as a methodology to include soft labels</italic> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007078.s003">S1 Text</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the gene rankings obtained by running Cardigan on the entire OMIM diseases set are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007078.s002">S2 Dataset</xref>.

In weighted networks, links between two proteins are labelled with a weight whose value is related to the probability of the interaction. In binary networks, links are not labelled and a link is either present or missing (denoting the existence or the lack of interaction). Moreover, interaction data can be experimental or predicted. In order to show the general applicability of our methodology, we performed our tests using different types of protein interaction networks including weighted and binary networks with both experimental and predicted data: HPRD [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], DiamondNet [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and BioGRID [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] are binary experimental networks; HIPPIE [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] is a weighted experimental network; FUNCOUP is a large weighted network including both experimental and predicted data. Table B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007078.s003">S1 Text</xref> summarizes some of the relevant characteristics of these networks.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Other prediction methods</title><p>We compared Cardigan to four methods: ProDiGe1, ProDiGe4[<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], PRINCE [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and DIAMOnD [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These were chosen because they are state-of-the-art representatives of the disease gene prediction methods and of the disease module prediction methods described earlier.</p><p>ProDiGe [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] is a family of kernel-based disease gene prediction methods which rank all genes within the protein-protein interaction network for a given disease. The main idea is to learn missing disease-gene associations through a one-class SVM, where known associations are established as positive labels and the other associations are unlabelled. ProDiGe allows gene associations to be shared among separate diseases. Positive labels are produced by multiplying the known disease-gene association matrix and a disease sharing kernel, and the SVM learns using a graph diffusion kernel created from the PPI network. The four methods in the family (ProDiGe1 to 4) differ in the disease sharing kernel: ProDiGe1 does not share genes (the disease sharing kernel is the identity matrix); ProDiGe2 establishes a uniform low probability to genes from other diseases (the disease sharing kernel is the identity plus a small constant); ProDiGe3 allows genes to be shared by using a phenotype similarity kernel (the disease sharing kernel is the van Driel similarity matrix [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]); and ProDiGe4 adds the kernels from ProDiGe1 and ProDiGe3 to give more importance to the genes of the disease of interest. We chose ProDiGe1 and ProDiGe4 as representatives of the disease gene prediction methods as they have been shown to outperform other well-known methods, such as Endeavour [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and a multiple kernel learning approach (MKL1class) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in the top 200 predictions, and they are comparable in performance to newer methods such as BiRW [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], HSSVM [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and HSMP [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] when predicting a single disease gene at a time.</p><p>PRINCE [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] is a diffusion-based method that uses the Zhou <italic>et al</italic>. iterative propagation [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] to prioritize genes. It makes use of the disease phenotype information provided by the van Driel similarity matrix [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to gather additional seeds for the query disease. The phenotype information allows genes from highly similar diseases to be effectively regarded as if they were known genes of the query disease (in contrast, our method uses a dampening factor to differentiate the weights assigned to genes from diseases other than the query).</p><p>DIAMOnD [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] is a recent disease module prediction method based on direct neighbor analysis which starts from a set of initial seeds and iteratively increases the module by adding new genes. At each iteration, the algorithm evaluates which genes have more connections to the existing disease module than expected by random chance, using the hypergeometric distribution as the null model. The most connected gene according to this model is then added and the authors consider the first 200 to 500 genes as the recovered disease module. Although DIAMOnD is not intended to be a fully-fledged disease gene prediction method, the order in which the genes are added to the module naturally produces a ranking that prioritizes disease genes.</p><p>In our experiments, we used the implementations of ProDiGe1, ProDiGe4 and DIAMOnD which were provided in their respective publications. Additionally, we developed our own implementation of PRINCE which uses all the recommended parameters specified in the publication.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>The Caniza similarity</title><p>Caniza et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007078.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] recently proposed a measure to quantify the phenotypical similarity between hereditary diseases. Their method begins by collecting, for each disease, the set of MeSH terms assigned to the scientific publications relevant for that disease. The phenotype similarity for a pair of diseases is then quantified by the information content of the term on the MeSH ontology that is the lowest common ancestor between the sets of terms for the two diseases. In practice, the similarity is calculated for the diseases found in OMIM, using the publications that OMIM associates to the diseases. The authors have shown that the similarity between two diseases is correlated with the closeness of their respective disease modules on the interactome.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Implementation</title><p>Our method is available as a fast, industrial strength library for Python 2.7 which implements sparse matrices and lazy loading for disease similarities to reduce the memory footprint.
